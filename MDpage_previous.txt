The Maryland Department of Information Technology (“DoIT”) offers
translations of the content through Google Translate. Because Google Translate

translated content. All DoIT content is filtered through Google Translate
which may result in unexpected and unpredictable degradation of portions

================================================ El Departamento de Tecnología
de la Información de Maryland (DoIT, siglas en inglés) ofrece traducciones
del contenido a través del Traductor Google (Google Translate). Debido a que
el Traductor Google es un sitio web externo, el DoIT no controla la calidad
o exactitud del contenido traducido. Todo el contenido del DoIT es filtrado
a través del Traductor Google lo que puede resultar en una degradación
inesperada o impredecible de porciones del texto, imágenes y la apariencia
general de las páginas traducidas. El Traductor Google puede mantener una
política de uso y privacidad únicas. Estas políticas no son controladas
por el DoIT y no están asociadas con las políticas de privacidad y uso
del DoIT. Después de seleccionar una opción de traducción, los usuarios
serán notificados de que están abandonando el sitio web del DoIT. Los
usuarios deben consultar el contenido original en inglés en el sitio web
del DoIT si tienen alguna pregunta acerca del contenido traducido. El DoIT
usa el Traductor Google para proporcionar traducciones lingüísticas de
su contenido. El Traductor Google es un servicio gratis y automatizado
que se basa en datos y tecnología para proporcionar sus traducciones. La

informativos. Las traducciones no pueden ser garantizadas como exactas o
sin la inclusión de lenguaje incorrecto o inapropiado. El Traductor Google
es un servicio de terceros y los usuarios del sitio dejarán al DoIT para
utilizar el contenido traducido. Como tal, el DoIT no garantiza y no acepta
responsabilidad por la exactitud, confiabilidad o desempeño de este servicio o
de las limitaciones proporcionadas por este servicio, tales como la inhabilidad
de traducir archivos específicos como PDF y gráficos (p.e. .jpgs, .gifs,
etc.). El DoIT proporciona el Traductor Google como una herramienta en línea
para sus usuarios, pero el DoIT no endosa directamente el sitio web o implica
que es la única solución disponible para los usuarios. Todos los visitantes
al sitio pueden escoger usar herramientas alternativas para sus necesidades
de traducción. Cualquier persona que utilice el contenido del DoIT en su
forma traducida, ya sea por el Traductor Google o por cualquier otro servicio
de traducción, lo hace bajo su propio riesgo. El DoIT no es responsable por
ninguna pérdida o daño que surja de, o problemas relacionados con el uso o
dependencia del contenido traducido. El DoIT no asume ninguna responsabilidad
por las actividades de los visitantes del sitio en conexión con el uso de
la funcionalidad o contenido del Traductor Google. El servicio del Traductor
Google es un medio por el cual el DoIT ofrece traducciones de contenido y
está destinado solamente para la conveniencia de los usuarios del sitio
web que no hablan inglés. El contenido traducido es proporcionado directa y
dinámicamente por Google; el DoIT no tiene control directo sobre el contenido
traducido tal y como aparece utilizando esta herramienta. Por lo tanto,
en todos los contextos, el contenido en inglés, tal y como se proporciona
por el DoIT será considerado como el autorizado. Google翻译免责声明
