through the new federal Rural Health Transformation Program, which HFS will

several provisions, it created the [Rural Health Transformation Program
(RHTP)](https://www.cms.gov/priorities/rural-health-transformation-rht-program/rural-health-transformation-rht-program),
a $50 billion fund for rural healthcare providers. All 50 states are eligible
to apply for this funding. **HFS submitted Illinois’ application for funding
to the federal Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) on Nov. 5,
2025.** Illinois’ Rural Health Transformation Program is designed to deliver
critical funding and drive sustainable change in our most underserved rural
communities—because every resident deserves access to high-quality care, no
matter where they live. $1 Billion Illinois is applying for $200 million per
year for five years, for a total of $1 billion. **Stakeholder Engagement:**
HFS held more than 38 stakeholder meetings, held a public listening session
with nearly 300 attendees, received over 120 written comments and proposal,
and held 46 follow-up meetings. **1,915,300** Illinois’ rural population is
estimated to include about 1.9 million people and represents approximately 15%
of the state’s population. **Lack of Care** 34% of Illinois counties do not
have any obstetric service. **Application goals** HFS developed a vision for
the future of rural healthcare in Illinois based on the five strategic goals
outlined by CMS. The RHTP application includes 3 categories of initiatives:
(1) Transforming Rural Healthcare; (2) Overcoming Geographic Barriers to Care;
(3) Building a Resilient Rural Workforce. The purpose of HFS’ RHTP is to
(1) invest in infrastructure and innovative models of care to right-size
care delivery in rural communities; (2) break down existing barriers to
care by bringing healthcare into the rural communities; and (3) build a
robust local workforce **Sample funding uses** Funds will be used to support
these initiatives through a combination of grants to and direct investments
in providers. Together, funds will be used toward hospital transformation
grants; primary care and behavioral health integration; value-based payment
initiatives; chronic disease prevention programming; infrastructure in EMS,
mobile health clinics, and mobile crisis units; investment in telehealth
and technological innovation; scholarship and university program expansion;
regional training and certification programs; expansion of community college
programs; and expansion of high-school community outreach programs. **Proposed

Funds to support eight key initiatives. 1. Hospital Transformation
1. Community Care Infrastructure 1. Hospital Disease Prevention 1. EMS and
Mobile Healthcare 1. Technology Innovation for Virtual Care 1. Healthcare

**HFS Statement following RHTP application submission – Nov. 6, 2025** The
Illinois Department of Healthcare and Family Services (HFS) has submitted an
application for the federal Rural Health Transformation Program (RHTP) that
is geared toward creating a stronger and more accessible healthcare system
in the rural communities in our state. The Department looks forward to the
federal Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services’ (CMS) funding allocation
announcement by the end of this year. HFS applied for a total of $1 billion,
or $200 million per year over five years, as instructed by federal CMS, which
instructed every state to apply for this same amount. Illinois’ application
was informed by extensive stakeholder feedback about how to best support
rural communities in the state. Before submitting the application, HFS engaged
with other state agencies, provider associations, rural hospitals and health
centers, community mental health centers, universities and community colleges,
legislators and vendors. HFS also held a listening session with nearly 300
