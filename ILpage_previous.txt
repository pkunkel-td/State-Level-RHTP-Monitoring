"RHTP Listening Session Recording") Rural Health Transformation Program
=================================== _On December 29 th, 2025, the federal
Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services awarded Illinois $193.4 million
for calendar year 2026 through the new federal Rural Health Transformation
Program, which HFS will distribute with the goal of strengthening healthcare
infrastructure in the state’s rural areas, creating more equitable access to
healthcare and improving health outcomes for Illinoisans statewide. Subsequent
program year funding will be determined by federal CMS on an annual basis. See
[HFS' news release](https://www.illinois.gov/news/release.html?releaseid=32058)
for more information._ ### What is the Rural Health Transformation
Program? On July 4, 2025, P.L. 119-21, or HR 1, was signed into law. Among
several provisions, it created the [Rural Health Transformation Program
(RHTP)](https://www.cms.gov/priorities/rural-health-transformation-rht-program/rural-health-transformation-rht-program),
a $50 billion fund for rural healthcare providers. All 50 states are eligible
to apply for this funding. **HFS submitted Illinois’ application for funding
to the federal Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) on Nov. 5,
2025.** Illinois RHTP Application Details ---------------------------------
### Illinois’ Vision Illinois’ Rural Health Transformation Program
is designed to deliver critical funding and drive sustainable change in
our most underserved rural communities—because every resident deserves
access to high-quality care, no matter where they live. **Fast Facts**
$1 Billion Illinois is applying for $200 million per year for five years,
for a total of $1 billion. **Stakeholder Engagement:** HFS held more than
38 stakeholder meetings, held a public listening session with nearly 300
attendees, received over 120 written comments and proposal, and held 46
follow-up meetings. **1,915,300** Illinois’ rural population is estimated
to include about 1.9 million people and represents approximately 15% of the
state’s population. **Lack of Care** 34% of Illinois counties do not have
any obstetric service. **Application goals** HFS developed a vision for the
future of rural healthcare in Illinois based on the five strategic goals
outlined by CMS. The RHTP application includes 3 categories of initiatives:
(1) Transforming Rural Healthcare; (2) Overcoming Geographic Barriers to Care;
(3) Building a Resilient Rural Workforce. The purpose of HFS’ RHTP is to
(1) invest in infrastructure and innovative models of care to right-size
care delivery in rural communities; (2) break down existing barriers to
care by bringing healthcare into the rural communities; and (3) build a
robust local workforce **Sample funding uses** Funds will be used to support
these initiatives through a combination of grants to and direct investments
in providers. Together, funds will be used toward hospital transformation
grants; primary care and behavioral health integration; value-based payment
initiatives; chronic disease prevention programming; infrastructure in EMS,
mobile health clinics, and mobile crisis units; investment in telehealth
and technological innovation; scholarship and university program expansion;
regional training and certification programs; expansion of community college
programs; and expansion of high-school community outreach programs. **Proposed
Strategic initiatives** Illinois proposes using Rural Health Transformation
Funds to support eight key initiatives. 1. Hospital Transformation
1. Community Care Infrastructure 1. Hospital Disease Prevention 1. EMS and
Mobile Healthcare 1. Technology Innovation for Virtual Care 1. Healthcare
Workforce Expansion 1. Training Healthcare Support Workers 1. Rural Health
Education Pipeline **Next Steps** * Federal CMS will make award announcements
by December 31, 2025; * HFS will enter into budget negotiations with federal
CMS; * Continued stakeholder engagement with grant partner entities,
trade groups, and others; * Staff planning and implementation at HFS in
partnership with other state agencies. More details on the federal Rural
Health Transformation Program and Illinois’ application for funding
can be found in [HFS’ November 2025 RHTP Update to the Illinois General
Assembly.](https://hfs.illinois.gov/content/dam/soi/en/web/hfs/sitecollectiondocuments/ilgarhtbbriefing112025.pdf)
**HFS Statement following RHTP application submission – Nov. 6, 2025** The
Illinois Department of Healthcare and Family Services (HFS) has submitted
an application for the federal Rural Health Transformation Program (RHTP)
that is geared toward creating a stronger and more accessible healthcare
system in the rural communities in our state. The Department looks forward
to the federal Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services’ (CMS) funding
allocation announcement by the end of this year. HFS applied for a total of $1
billion, or $200 million per year over five years, as instructed by federal
CMS, which instructed every state to apply for this same amount. Illinois’
application was informed by extensive stakeholder feedback about how to best
support rural communities in the state. Before submitting the application,
HFS engaged with other state agencies, provider associations, rural hospitals
and health centers, community mental health centers, universities and
community colleges, legislators and vendors. HFS also held a listening
session with nearly 300 attendees and received over 120 written public
comments and proposals. Footer ------ Back to top ### Stay Informed * [Public
