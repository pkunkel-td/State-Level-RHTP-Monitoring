Background ----------
[H.R.1](https://www.congress.gov/bill/119th-congress/house-bill/1/text)
amended section 2105 of the Social Security Act. The bill, signed into
law on 7/4/2025, made major changes to public assistance programs
such as Medicaid and SNAP. These changes will lead to significant
cuts to those programs, and loss of coverage for the Minnesotans
who rely on them. In an attempt to encourage innovative forms of care
delivery in rural areas, the legislation created a [Rural Health Transformation
Program](https://www.cms.gov/priorities/rural-health-transformation-rht-program/rural-health-transformation-rht-program)
as a one-time effort to fund rural health priorities over the next five
years. The bill language specifies that: * Half (50%) of funds will be
distributed equally to each state with an approved application over 5
federal fiscal years. This is equivalent to $25 billion that will be
distributed to states over five years through annual payments between
Federal Fiscal Years 2026-2030. * The remaining 50% of funds ($25 billion)
will be distributed among at least one-fourth of the states with approved
applications, at the discretion of the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid
Services (CMS) Administrator. Application ----------- Minnesota's plan to
improve rural health is built on actionable data, strong partnerships,
and encouraging communities to have a say in what they need most. The
plan recommends new tools and methods to improve provider financial
sustainability and extend access to care into trusted community
settings throughout rural Minnesota. For summary information, review
the [Minnesota Rural Health Transformation Program Application Fact Sheet
(PDF).](https://www.health.state.mn.us/facilities/ruralhealth/ruraltrans/docs/rhtpfacts.pdf)
For detailed information, review the full [Minnesota
Rural Health Transformation Program Project Narrative

For answers to frequently asked questions,
review the [Rural Health Transformation Program FAQ
(PDF).](https://www.health.state.mn.us/facilities/ruralhealth/ruraltrans/docs/rhtpfaq.pdf)
Funding levels will be determine by CMS by the end of December, and
may affect the range of activities. MDH will share more information
about the budget, sub-awards, and notices of funding opportunities as
it becomes available. Considerations The CMS Administrator will consider
the following in determining allotments to each state: * The percentage
of the state’s population that is located in a rural census tract of
a metropolitan statistical area (MSA). * The proportion of rural health
facilities (defined below) in the state relative to the number of rural
health facilities nationwide. * The situation of hospitals in the state. *
Any other factors that the CMS Administrator finds appropriate. To receive
funds, Minnesota will submit one application to CMS for the entire 5-year
funding period. This application must outline the state’s proposed
Rural Health Transformation Plan. Rural Health Transformation Plan The
Rural Health Transformation Plan must demonstrate how the state will: *
Improve access to hospitals and other providers for rural residents. *
Improve health care outcomes of rural residents. * Prioritize use of new
and emerging technologies that emphasize prevention and chronic disease
management. * Initiate, foster, and strengthen local and regional strategic
partnerships between rural hospitals and other providers to promote quality
improvement, increase financial stability, maximize economies of scale,
and share best practices. * Recruit and retain clinicians. * Prioritize
data and technology-driven solutions that help rural providers furnish
health care services as close to the patient's home as possible. * Outline
strategies to manage long-term financial solvency and operating models of
rural hospitals. * Identify specific causes that are driving standalone rural
hospitals to close, convert, or reduce service lines. Eligible Activities
States will be allowed to use funds for 3 or more of the following eligible
activities and must outline how these activities will achieve the goals of the
transformation plan. 1. Promoting evidence-based, measurable interventions to
improve prevention and chronic disease management. 2. Providing payments to
health care providers for the provision of health care items or services,
as specified by the CMS Administrator. 3. Promoting consumer-facing,
technology-driven solutions for the prevention and management of chronic
diseases. 4. Providing training and technical assistance for the development
and adoption of technology-enabled solutions that improve care delivery
in rural hospitals, including remote monitoring, robotics, artificial
intelligence, and other advanced technologies. 5. Recruiting and retaining
clinical workforce talent to rural areas, with commitments to serve rural
communities for a minimum of 5 years. 6. Providing technical assistance,
software, and hardware for significant information technology advances
designed to improve efficiency, enhance cybersecurity capability development,
and improve patient health outcomes. 7. Assisting rural communities to right
size their health care delivery systems by identifying needed preventative,
ambulatory, pre-hospital, emergency, acute inpatient care, outpatient care,
and post-acute care service lines. 8. Supporting access to opioid use disorder
treatment services, other substance use disorder treatment services, and
mental health services. 9. Developing projects that support innovative models
of care that include value-based care arrangements and alternative payment
models. 10. Additional uses to promote sustainable access to high quality
rural health care services, as determined by the CMS Administrator. Provide
