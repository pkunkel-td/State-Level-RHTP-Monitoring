Goal and Key Initiatives ------------------------ To support rural providers
in transforming care delivery models, improving financial visibility,
and enhancing health outcomes for rural populations. **15 Key Initiatives
Driving Transformation** Rural Clinics & Satellite Clinics⌄ Enhancing
access to primary, dental, behavioral, and chronic care as well as urgent
care. These clinics offer primary care, dental, chronic disease management,
obstetric and gynecologic care, and mental health services, promoting
preventive care and early intervention. Mobile Health⌄ Mobile units
deliver preventive and diagnostic screening, prenatal, and rehabilitation
services in remote areas, with the ability to receive support for the
sharing of data in real time through the Florida Health Information Exchange
(HIE). Community Paramedicine⌄ Deploying community paramedics and other
licensed practitioners to provide on-site support for minor illnesses within
their scope of practice and deliver post-discharge care for high-risk patients,
to reduce readmission. Behavioral Health Telehealth & Telehub⌄ Establishes
regional centers that connect rural residents to same-day psychiatric
consultations, therapy, and coordinated care. This reduces behavioral
health emergency visits; and improved continuity of care/follow-up for
patients with mental health or substance use disorders. Tele-Specialties &
Imaging⌄ Enables rural hospitals and clinics to host virtual specialty
clinics, allowing patients to consult with specialists like cardiologists,
pulmonologists, endocrinologists, oncologists, and neurologists via
telehealth. Tele–Intensive Care Unit (eICU)⌄ Enables rural hospitals
to connect with remote critical care physicians and nurses who provide 24/7
patient monitoring through secure video and data systems, reducing mortality
rates for critical care and stroke patients and increased hospital capacity
for more complex care. Hub-and-Spoke Telestroke with Transfer⌄ Connects
rural emergency departments with stroke specialists via secure, real-time
video for immediate assessment and treatment. CT scans are scans of patients
are transmitted electronically to remote neurologists for rapid review and
diagnosis. Workforce Development⌄ The program will also offer partnerships
with high schools and community colleges to expand curriculum development
and training for allied health workers that allows residents to “learn and
serve” locally. All participants will commit to a five-year rural service
period, ensuring long-term retention and continuity of care. Value-Based
Purchasing⌄ Transitions rural healthcare providers from a fee-for-service
model to performance-based payment models that rewards quality, outcomes,
and efficiency. Remote Patient Telemonitoring⌄ Allows rural patients with
chronic conditions such as hypertension, diabetes, heart failure, and COPD
to use connected devices like blood pressure cuffs, glucose meters, and
scales to transmit health data directly to care teams. Health & Lifestyle
Programs⌄ Providers screen for food insecurity, offer brief nutrition
counseling, and link families to local food resources. This will lower the
prevalence of obesity and chronic diseases; improved nutrition security,
and increased uptake in practitioner education on nutrition. On-Site
Pharmacy⌄ Provides funding for on-site clinical support or telehealth
kiosks at local pharmacies. Diagnostic Technology Support⌄ Financing
for cloud-based Picture Archiving and Communications System. FL HIE/ENS
Onboarding⌄ Funds onboarding for rural hospitals, clinics, and providers
to the Florida HIE and ENS. The program enhances care coordination,
reduces readmissions, and promotes seamless transitions between care
settings. Dually Eligible Special Needs Plans (D-SNPs)⌄ Supports
comprehensive education and outreach strategies to increase awareness,
understanding, and participation in integrated Medicare-Medicaid care
models. Where We’re Making an Impact ---------------------------- [![Image
