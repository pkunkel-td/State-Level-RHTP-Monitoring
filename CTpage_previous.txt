see the Department of Social Services’ webpage at this
[**link**](https://portal.ct.gov/dss/rural-health-transformation-program/public-comment)for
public comment opportunities. Federal law in Public Law
(PL) 119-21, also known as H.R. 1, section 71401 (posted at this
[l**ink**](https://www.cms.gov/files/document/chapter-4-protecting-rural-health-hospitals-providers.pdf)),
creates a new Rural Health Transformation Program (RHTP). All fifty states
can submit a one-time grant application to the U.S. Centers for Medicare
and Medicaid Services (CMS). Based on the federal law funding formula ($10
billion annually for five years, half split evenly across all states with
approved applications and half allocated by CMS based on various factors), it
is anticipated that Connecticut, upon federal approval of the application,
will receive at least $100 million per year for five years starting in
2026. The State of Connecticut Department of Social Services (DSS) is
collaborating with several state agencies in preparing Connecticut’s
RHTP grant application, including the Offices of the Governor (OTG),
Policy and Management (OPM), Rural Health (ORH), Health Strategy (OHS),
and the Departments of Public Health (DPH), Mental Health and Addiction
Services (DMHAS), and Children and Families (DCF). Our goal is to leverage
RHTP to improve the health of residents in rural areas of the state. ####
**Federal Requirements – Rural Health Transformation Plan** The state
must submit a Rural Health Transformation Plan as part of its RHTP grant
application, which must include all of these specific topics detailed in
federal law: * Improve access to hospitals, other health care providers, and
health care items and services furnished to rural residents of the state; *
Improve health care outcomes of rural residents of the state; * Prioritize
the use of new and emerging technologies that emphasize prevention and
chronic disease management; * Initiate, foster, and strengthen local and
regional strategic partnerships between rural hospitals and other health
care providers in order to promote measurable quality improvement, increase
financial stability, maximize economies of scale, and share best practices in
care delivery; * Enhance economic opportunity for, and the supply of, health
care clinicians through enhanced recruitment and training; * Prioritize
data and technology driven solutions that help rural hospitals and other
rural health care providers furnish high-quality health care services as
close to a patient’s home as is possible; * Outline strategies to manage
long-term financial solvency and operating models of rural hospitals in
the state; and * Identify specific causes driving the accelerating rate
of stand-alone rural hospitals becoming at risk of closure, conversion, or
service reduction. #### **Federal Requirements – Allowable Uses of Grant
Funds** Federal law provides specific rules on the allowable uses of RHTP
funds, which CMS grouped into five categories: * Make rural America healthy
again * Sustainable access * Workforce development * Innovative care * Tech
innovation Specifically, states must use RHTP funds for three or more of the
approved uses of funds: * Promoting evidence-based, measurable interventions
to improve prevention and chronic disease management. * Providing payments to
health care providers for the provision of health care items or services, as
specified by the Administrator. * Promoting consumer-facing, technology-driven
solutions for the prevention and management of chronic diseases. * Providing
training and technical assistance for the development and adoption of
technology-enabled solutions that improve care delivery in rural hospitals,
including remote monitoring, robotics, artificial intelligence, and other
advanced technologies. * Recruiting and retaining clinical workforce talent
to rural areas, with commitments to serve rural communities for a minimum
of five years. * Providing technical assistance, software, and hardware for
significant information technology advances designed to improve efficiency,
enhance cybersecurity capability development, and improve patient health
outcomes. * Assisting rural communities to right size their health care
delivery systems by identifying needed preventive, ambulatory, pre-hospital,
emergency, acute inpatient care, outpatient care, and post-acute care service
lines. * Supporting access to opioid use disorder treatment services, other
substance use disorder treatment services, and mental health services. *
Developing projects that support innovative models of care that include
value-based care arrangements and alternative payment models, as appropriate. *
Additional uses designed to promote sustainable access to high quality
rural health care services, as determined by the Administrator. For

#### **State Priorities** In addition to federal rules, Connecticut’s
initial priorities for the RHTP are activities that: * Benefit the health of
residents living in the state’s rural areas, focused on interventions with
long-term benefits; * Can be accomplished within the established demonstration
period consistent with federal requirements for the RHTP; and * Demonstrate
long-term scalability and financial sustainability, such as by maximizing
other available resources and without necessarily requiring new state
funding. * [Policies](https://portal.ct.gov/Policies/State-Privacy-Policy) *
