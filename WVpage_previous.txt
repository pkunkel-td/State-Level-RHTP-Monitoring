====================================== #### The West Virginia Rural Health
Transformation Program **The West Virginia Rural Health Transformation
(RHT) Program** is a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to improve healthcare
outcomes, build a healthy and stable workforce, and develop a more vibrant
economy. Enabled by strategic investments in technology and unprecedented
collaboration with our rural communities, improving health outcomes will
serve as the foundation of West Virginia’s new economic strength. Thanks to
funding included in President Donald J. Trump’s One Big Beautiful Bill, the
RHT Program will provide West Virginia at least $500 million to revolutionize
rural healthcare throughout the state. While the final amount to be received
from the federal government will not be known until December 31, Governor
Patrick Morrisey has developed a bold vision to invest those resources through
seven flagship initiatives. For a detailed summary of West Virginia’s
plan,[click here](https://governor.wv.gov/rht-detailed-summary). ####
