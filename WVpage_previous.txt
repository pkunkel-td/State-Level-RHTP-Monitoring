Rural Health Transformation Program is a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity
to improve healthcare outcomes, build a healthy and stable workforce,
and develop a more vibrant economy. Enabled by strategic investments in
technology and unprecedented collaboration with our rural communities,
improving health outcomes will serve as the foundation of West Virginia’s
new economic strength. Thanks to funding included in President Donald
J. Trump’s One Big Beautiful Bill, the RHT Program will provide
West Virginia at least $500 million to revolutionize rural healthcare
throughout the state. While the final amount to be received from the
federal government will not be known until December 31, Governor Patrick
Morrisey has developed a bold vision to invest those resources through
seven flagship initiatives. For a detailed summary of West Virginia’s
