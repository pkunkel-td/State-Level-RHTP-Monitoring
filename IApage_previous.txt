The One Big Beautiful Bill Act (Section 71401) creates a new Rural
Health Transformation (RHT) grants program administered by the Centers
for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS), allocating $50 billion
nationwide from federal fiscal years 2026 through 2030 — $10 billion
annually. Funds will flow through states, which must submit a Rural
Health Transformation Plan to CMS by Dec. 31, 2025, to access and manage
these resources. To learn more about the RHT program, [visit the CMS website

Hometowns** is the state’s submission to the [Rural**Health Transformation
Program**](https://gcc02.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.cms.gov%2Fpriorities%2Frural-health-transformation-rht-program%2Foverview&data=05%7C02%7Csarah.ekstrand%40hhs.iowa.gov%7Ca7810fd586a1437e2ebc08de1c916795%7C8d2c7b4d085a4617853638a76d19b0da%7C1%7C0%7C638979607994930534%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJFbXB0eU1hcGkiOnRydWUsIlYiOiIwLjAuMDAwMCIsIlAiOiJXaW4zMiIsIkFOIjoiTWFpbCIsIldUIjoyfQ%3D%3D%7C0%7C%7C%7C&sdata=XrYnSLim6HvjaVpzQQly%2FlrWp%2Fpl8X6V6fJ7B24VgZQ%3D&reserved=0),
a federal funding initiative managed by the Centers for Medicare and
Medicaid Services (CMS). The bold and comprehensive proposal is aimed
at building a high-quality, sustainable system of care that improves
the health, well-being, and quality of life in rural communities
across the state. If fully awarded, Iowa could receive $200 million
per project year period (a total of $1 billion over the 5-year grant). [Back to

An initiative that builds formal partnerships to restructure healthcare
delivery options for rural communities. This includes an expansion
of Iowa Governor Kim Reynolds' Centers of Excellence Program and a
rare opportunity to develop enhanced Health Hubs, or hub-and-spoke
networks of care, with investments in telehealth, specialized
medical equipment, provider recruitment and retention, efficient
space utilization, and limited funds to support care for uninsured
Iowans. Health Hubs may include school-based service provision. This
initiative also includes **Best and Brightest,**a sub-initiative
to recruit and retain an excellent rural healthcare workforce. [Back to

Combat Cancer-Prevent and Treat -------------------------------
An initiative to comprehensively tackle cancer throughout the state
via increasing access to cancer screening, forming cancer-specific
Health Hubs, upgrading equipment for cancer screening and treatment,
delivering supportive care for families impacted by cancer, and supporting
studies and analyses by academic partners. Iowa will address lung cancer
prevention through radon testing and mitigation, breast cancer by paying
for mammograms and follow-up breast MRIs, colorectal cancer through FIT
tests and follow-up colonoscopies, skin cancer through telehealth and
new equipment, and prostate cancer through routine screening methods. [Back to

homes or to easily accessible sites in their communities. [Back to
