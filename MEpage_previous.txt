Rural Health Transformation Program ===================================
Maine Awarded $190 million for Year 1 -------------------------------------
On December 29, 2025 the State of Maine received [official notification
(PDF)](https://www.maine.gov/dhhs/sites/maine.gov.dhhs/files/inline-files/NOA_Maines%20Rural%20Health%20Transformation%20Plan.pdf)from
the U.S. Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) of a $190 million
award for Year 1 of the federal Rural Health Transformation Program. The award
period spans from December 29, 2025, through October 30, 2026, and will support
Maine's efforts to expand access to care, improve population health, strengthen
the rural health workforce, advance technology and data integration, and
promote the long-term sustainability of rural health systems statewide. [CMS'
Announcement](https://www.cms.gov/newsroom/press-releases/cms-announces-50-billion-awards-strengthen-rural-health-all-50-states)
provides additional detail and an overview of funding
awards to all 50 states. Maine's Application for Funding
------------------------------- Supporting materials to Maine's
application for funding through the Rural Health Transformation
Program are available, including the [Summary of Maine's RHTP Plan
(PDF)](https://www.maine.gov/dhhs/sites/maine.gov.dhhs/files/inline-files/SoM_RHTP%20SubmissionSummary.pdf)
and the updated* [State of Maine RHTP Project Narrative

_*On December 8, 2025, CMS notified Maine DHHS that it had completed the
programmatic review of Maine's RHTP proposal, and identified one question that
they asked the Maine team to answer: "How will small rural providers develop
and sustain the capacity needed for advanced payment models?"_ Valuable Public
Input -- Partner Engagement -------------------------------------------
Thank you to the many people and partners who took the time to
share their ideas, expertise, and experiences. Your feedback helped
guide how these important funds can best support rural health
in Maine. The State of Maine hosted public information webinars
about RHTP, which can be viewed in their entirety: * [September 23: Webinar

About the Rural Health Transformation Program
--------------------------------------------- The RHTP was created within the
federal budget reconciliation bill, H.R. 1 (Section 71401 of Public Law 119-21)
which was signed into law on July 4, 2025 and makes [significant cuts to
Medicaid](https://www.maine.gov/dhhs/blog/federal-budget-reconciliation-law-now-effect-impacts-mainecare-snap-covermegov-2025-07-11).
These cuts are permanent and expected to increase the number of uninsured
individuals and costs to provide health care to those individuals over the
next several years, particularly in rural areas. Nationally, these Medicaid
cuts amount to nearly $1 trillion over the next 10 years. That includes an
estimated $5 billion in cuts to Maine. States may also receive competitive
discretionary funding above that amount. Funding for RHTP is temporary and
one-time and must be used within the specified time period. RHTP Structure &
Funding: ------------------------- Total funding for the RHTP is $50 billion
nationally, to be allocated to approved States over five fiscal years, with
$10 billion of funding available each fiscal year, beginning in fiscal year
2026 and ending in fiscal year 2030. The funding will be distributed by the
U.S. Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) as follows: * 50% to be
distributed equally amongst all States with a CMS-approved RHTP plan. * 50%
will be allocated by CMS to a subset of states based on a variety of factors
including rural population, the proportion of rural health facilities in the
state, the situation of certain hospitals in the state, and other factors to
be specified by CMS. ### Required Components: To qualify for RHTP funding,
the State of Maine addressed specific components required by the federal
law, including how Maine's RHTP plan will: * Improve access to hospitals,
other health care providers, and health care items and services provided
to rural residents * Improve health care outcomes of rural residents *
Prioritize the use of new and emerging technologies that emphasize prevention
and chronic disease management * Initiate, foster, and strengthen local and
regional strategic partnerships between rural hospitals, and other health
care providers to promote measurable quality improvement, increase financial
stability, maximize economies of scale, and share best practices in care
delivery * Enhance economic opportunity for, and the supply of, health care
clinicians through enhanced recruitment and training * Prioritize data-
and technology-driven solutions that help rural hospitals and other rural
health care providers provide high-quality health care services as close
to a person's home as is possible * Outline strategies to manage long-term
financial solvency and operating models of rural hospitals in the state *
Identify specific causes that drive the increased rate of stand-alone rural
hospitals becoming at risk of closure, conversion, or service reduction ###
States must also commit to using RHTP funds to support three or more of
the following 10 allowable activities: 1. Promoting evidence-based,
measurable interventions to improve prevention and chronic disease
management. 2. Providing payments to health care providers for the
provision of health care items or services, as specified by the CMS
Administrator. 3. Promoting consumer-facing, technology-driven solutions
for the prevention and management of chronic diseases. 4. Providing
training and technical assistance for the development and adoption of
technology-enabled solutions that improve care delivery in rural hospitals,
including remote monitoring, robotics, artificial intelligence, and other
advanced technologies. 5. Recruiting and retaining clinical workforce
talent to rural areas, with commitments to serve rural communities for
a minimum of five years. 6. Providing technical assistance, software,
and hardware for significant information technology advances designed to
improve efficiency, enhance cybersecurity capability development, and improve
patient health outcomes. 7. Assisting rural communities to right-size their
health care delivery systems by identifying needed preventative, ambulatory,
pre-hospital, emergency, acute inpatient care, outpatient care, and post-acute
care service lines. 8. Supporting access to opioid use disorder treatment
services, other substance use disorder treatment services, and mental
health services. 9. Developing projects that support innovative models of
care that include value-based care arrangements and alternative payment
models, as appropriate. 10. Additional uses designed to promote sustainable
access to high-quality rural health care services, as determined by the CMS
Administrator. ### Additionally, CMS has identified the following strategic
goals for the RHTP: * **Make rural America healthy again**: Support rural
health innovations and new access points to promote preventative health
and address root causes of diseases. Projects will use evidence-based,
outcomes-driven interventions to improve disease prevention, chronic disease
management, behavioral health, and prenatal care. * **Sustainable access**:
Help rural providers become long-term access points for care by improving
efficiency and sustainability. With RHTP support, rural facilities work
together--or with high-quality regional systems--to share or coordinate
operations, technology, primary and specialty care, and emergency services. *
**Workforce development**: Attract and retain a high-skilled health care
workforce by strengthening recruitment and retention of healthcare providers in
rural communities. Help rural providers practice at the top of their license
and develop a broader set of providers to serve a rural community's needs,
such as community health workers, pharmacists, and individuals trained to
help patients navigate the healthcare system. * **Innovative care**: Spark
the growth of innovative care models to improve health outcomes, coordinate
care, and promote flexible care arrangements. Develop and implement payment
mechanisms incentivizing providers or Accountable Care Organizations (ACOs) to
reduce health care costs, improve quality of care, and shift care to lower cost
settings. * **Technology innovation**: Foster use of innovative technologies
that promote efficient care delivery, data security, and access to digital
health tools by rural facilities, providers, and patients. Projects support
access to remote care, improve data sharing, strengthen cybersecurity,
and invest in emerging technologies. Press releases --------------
