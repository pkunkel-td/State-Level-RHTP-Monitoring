Rural Health Transformation Program ===================================
The Ohio Rural Health Transformation Program focuses on improving the
health of rural communities through innovation, strategic partnerships,
infrastructure development, and workforce investment. The Rural
Health Transformation (RHT) Program was authorized by the One Big
Beautiful Bill Act (Section 71401 of Public Law 119-21). All states are
eligible to apply for this funding, and the State of Ohio will submit an
application. If awarded, it will manage the funds which can be utilized
to address the federally established strategic goals outlined below. The
RHT is administered by the Centers for Medicaid and Medicaid Services
(CMS). * [Governor DeWine Announces Ohio's Rural Health Transformation Program

Strategic Goals --------------- ### Make Rural America Healthy Again
click to expand Support rural health innovations and new access points to
promote preventive health and address root causes of diseases. Projects
will use evidence-based, outcomes-driven interventions to improve disease
prevention, chronic disease management, behavioral health, and prenatal
care. ### Sustainable Access in Rural Communities click to expand Help rural
providers become long-term access points for care by improving efficiency and
sustainability. With RHT Program support, rural facilities work together—or
with high-quality regional systems—to share or coordinate operations,
technology, primary and specialty care, and emergency services. ### Rural
Health Workforce Development click to expand Attract and retain a high-skilled
healthcare workforce by strengthening recruitment and retention of healthcare
providers in rural communities. Help rural providers practice at the top
of their license and develop a broader set of providers to serve a rural
community’s needs, such as community health workers, pharmacists, and
individuals trained to help patients navigate the healthcare system. ###
Innovative Care for Rural Residents click to expand Spark the growth
of innovative care models to improve health outcomes, coordinate care,
and promote flexible care arrangements. Develop and implement payment
mechanisms incentivizing providers or accountable care organizations (ACOs)
to reduce healthcare costs, improve quality of care, and shift care to
lower cost settings. ### Tech Innovation to Improve Service Delivery to
Rural Communities click to expand Foster use of innovative technologies
that promote efficient care delivery, data security, and access to digital
health tools by rural facilities, providers, and patients. Projects support
access to remote care, improve data sharing, strengthen cybersecurity, and
invest in emerging technologies. Eligible Activities -------------------
* **Promoting evidence-based, measurable interventions** to improve
prevention and chronic disease management. * **Promoting consumer-facing,
technology-driven solutions** for the prevention and management of chronic
diseases. * **Providing payments to healthcare providers** for the provision of
healthcare items or services. * **Providing training and technical assistance**
to develop and adopt technology enabled solutions that improve care delivery
in rural hospitals, including remote monitoring, robotics, artificial
intelligence, and other advanced technologies. * **Recruiting and retaining
clinical workforce talent** to rural areas, with commitments to serve rural
communities for a minimum of five years. * **Providing technical assistance,
software, and hardware** for significant information technology advances
that are designed to improve efficiency, enhance cybersecurity capability
development, and improve patient health outcomes. * **Assisting rural
communities** to right size their healthcare delivery systems by identifying
needed preventive, ambulatory, pre-hospital, emergency, acute inpatient
care, outpatient care, and post-acute care service lines. * **Supporting
access** to opioid use disorder treatment services, other substance use
disorder treatment services, and mental health services. * **Developing
projects** that support innovative models of care that include value-based
care arrangements and alternative payment models. * **Designing additional
activities** to promote sustainable access to high-quality rural healthcare
services, as determined by the CMS administrator. * **Designing/implementing
other programs** that support sustainable access to high-quality rural
healthcare services. Informational Call ------------------ **An informational
