"H.R. 1 Section 71401"), the One Big Beautiful Bill Act (OBBBA), enacted
on , establishes a new federal grant program called the Rural Health
Transformation (RHT) Program. This program provides **$10 billion per
year** for federal fiscal years 2026 through 2030 for a total of $50
billion. The new federal grant program is designed to mitigate some of
the effects of changes to Medicaid financing for rural hospitals and
providers resulting from the legislation. The Centers for Medicare &
Medicaid Services (CMS) released the Notice of Funding Opportunity (NOFO)

prepare Nevada’s Rural Health Transformation Plan (see [Nevada RHT Project
Narrative](https://nvha.nv.gov/uploadedFiles/nvhanvgov/content/Community/Project%20Narrative.pdf

will monitor progress across all initiatives and recommend adjustments
to ensure the Rural Health Transformation Plan maintains alignment with
federal goals and delivers lasting, transformational improvements in

"Nevada RHT Budget Narrative"). What is Nevada’s Plan for RHT
Funding? -------------------------------------- Nevada’s RHT Program
priorities were defined based on broad rural healthcare stakeholder involvement
and in close collaboration with the Governor’s Office. From August 20
to , the Nevada Health Authority gathered public comment and feedback on
how best to prioritize RHT funds in the state’s application. A second
opportunity to provide public feedback began with a follow-up survey,
open from October 6–10, 2025. Nevada’s application reflects feedback
and direct involvement from hundreds of stakeholders, including our rural
healthcare experts (EMS, tribal leadership, medical education, hospitals,
primary care, critical access hospitals, behavioral health professionals,
and rural and frontier Nevada residents) and alignment with the Governor’s
strategic plan objectives. The Nevada Health Authority worked to prioritize
initiatives avoiding state or local fiscal cliffs at the end of the 5-year
RHT grant and resulting in sustainable solutions to longstanding challenges
affecting access to care in rural Nevada. To guide this important work,
the Nevada Health Authority will form a Rural Health Transformation Steering
Committee (RHTSC) with members appointed by the Director of NVHA with approval
from the Governor of Nevada. The committee will be comprised of a broad array
of representatives from rural health systems and communities in addition
to state, local and tribal health representatives. The steering committee
will track progress on all RHT initiatives and recommend adjustments to
ensure alignment with federal goals. NVHA intends to deploy the following
4 initiatives, as further described in Nevada’s RHT grant application:
1. **Make Rural Nevada Healthy Again** – Through implementing the **Rural
Health Outcomes Accelerator Program (RHOAP)**, Nevada plans to invest 15%
of the annual award in efforts that promote value-based and innovative
care models that prevent and manage chronic disease. This includes (but not
limited to) new online collaborative care strategies, remote and/or hybrid
approaches to care, online patient health management tools, and virtual
provider mentorship programs. 2. **Strengthen Rural Health Systems** –
The Nevada Health Authority will introduce the **Flex Fund for Nevada’s
Rural Providers**, planning to bolster and modernize the state’s rural
health care infrastructure with 20% of the annual award in new investments
in items like technology, equipment, supplies, mobile units, emergency
services, etc. The State will encourage rural providers to leverage their
regional buying power through regional purchasing strategies and sharing
arrangements. 3. **Create a Robust Network of Health Providers in Rural
Nevada** – Through establishment of the **Workforce Recruitment and Rural
Access Program**, Nevada plans to address historic gaps in the state’s rural
workforce. Multiple strategies will be employed with the proposed support
of 40% of the annual award to address immediate and long-term provider
gaps, including new incentives for providers to live and serve in rural
areas of the state, tuition aid with commitments to serve rural Nevada,
and a rural physician residency program. 4. **Fill the “Unfillable”
Gaps with Innovative Technology Solutions** – The Nevada Health Authority
plans to implement the **Rural Health Innovation and Technology Grant** with
15% of the annual award toward innovative technologies and modernization
of health data and records systems with a focus on alignment with the CMS
Digital Health Ecosystem and addressing cybersecurity needs for rural health
systems. These funds may also be used to bolster the state’s rural telehealth
infrastructure. Requirements for a state’s Rural Health Transformation
Plan ----------------------------------------------------------- States
must include strategies to: * Improve access to hospitals, other providers,
and health care items and services furnished to rural residents. * Improve
health care outcomes of rural residents of the state. * Prioritize the use of
new and emerging technologies that emphasize prevention and chronic disease
management. * Initiate, foster, and strengthen local and regional strategic
partnerships between rural and other health care providers to promote quality
improvement, increased financial stability, maximize economies of scale, and
share best practices and care delivery. * Enhance economic opportunity for,
and the supply of, healthcare clinicians through enhanced recruitment and
training. Prioritize data and technology solutions that help rural hospitals
and providers furnish high quality services near a patient's home. * Outline
strategies to manage long-term financial solvency and operating models of
rural hospitals in the state. * Identify the specific causes driving the
accelerating rate of standalone rural hospitals becoming at risk of closure,
conversion, or service reduction.
