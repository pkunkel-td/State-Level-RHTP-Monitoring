Rural Health Transformation Program - Overview
---------------------------------------------- [H.R. 1 Section
71401](https://www.congress.gov/bill/119th-congress/house-bill/1/text "H.R. 1
Section 71401"), the One Big Beautiful Bill Act (OBBBA), enacted on July
4, 2025, establishes a new federal grant program called the Rural Health
Transformation (RHT) Program. This program provides **$10 billion per year**
for federal fiscal years 2026 through 2030 for a total of $50 billion. The
new federal grant program is designed to mitigate some of the effects of
changes to Medicaid financing for rural hospitals and providers resulting
from the legislation. The Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS)
released the Notice of Funding Opportunity (NOFO) and the Application
Instructions on September 15, 2025. This information established the
requirements and deadline for submission of a completed application of
November 5, 2025. The Nevada Health Authority worked diligently to gather
helpful public input from hundreds of stakeholder suggestions which were used
to prepare Nevada’s Rural Health Transformation Plan (see [Nevada RHT Project

"ADA Assistance, Opens in New Window")). Nevada’s completed RHT grant
application was successfully submitted on November 3, 2025. The OBBBA
requires that CMS finalize this grant program, including awards for states,
no later than December 31, 2025. Latest Updates -------------- **December
29, 2025:** Today, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS)
**awarded nearly $180 million** to the Nevada Health Authority (NVHA) for
the first year of the new federal Rural Health Transformation Program! The
five-year grant period begins 12/29/25 and runs through October 30,
2030. NVHA will announce opportunities for applicants to apply for Rural
Health Transformation Program funding later this spring and summer through
public workshops, this website, the NVHA ListServ, and additional communication
channels. To sign up for the NVHA ListServ, [click this link and send the blank

"click this link and send the blank email"). To guide implementation of this
important work, Nevada will establish a **Rural Health Transformation Steering
Committee (RHTSC)** early in 2026. Members will be appointed by the Nevada
Health Authority Director with approval from the Governor. The Committee
will monitor progress across all initiatives and recommend adjustments to
ensure the Rural Health Transformation Plan maintains alignment with federal
goals and delivers lasting, transformational improvements in rural healthcare
statewide. The RHTSC will be composed of a broad array of representatives from
rural health systems and communities in addition to state, local, and tribal
health representatives. RHTSC Applications closed January 19, 2026. Approved
2026 Steering Committee members to be announced soon! What is Nevada’s Plan
for RHT Funding? -------------------------------------- Nevada’s RHT Program
priorities were defined based on broad rural healthcare stakeholder involvement
and in close collaboration with the Governor’s Office. From August 20 to
September 22, 2025, the Nevada Health Authority gathered public comment and
feedback on how best to prioritize RHT funds in the state’s application. A
second opportunity to provide public feedback began with a follow-up survey,
open from October 6–10, 2025. Nevada’s application reflects feedback
and direct involvement from hundreds of stakeholders, including our rural
healthcare experts (EMS, tribal leadership, medical education, hospitals,
primary care, critical access hospitals, behavioral health professionals,
and rural and frontier Nevada residents) and alignment with the Governor’s
strategic plan objectives. The Nevada Health Authority worked to prioritize
initiatives avoiding state or local fiscal cliffs at the end of the 5-year
RHT grant and resulting in sustainable solutions to longstanding challenges
affecting access to care in rural Nevada. To guide this important work,
the Nevada Health Authority will form a Rural Health Transformation Steering
Committee (RHTSC) with members appointed by the Director of NVHA with approval
from the Governor of Nevada. The committee will be comprised of a broad array
of representatives from rural health systems and communities in addition
to state, local and tribal health representatives. The steering committee
will track progress on all RHT initiatives and recommend adjustments to
ensure alignment with federal goals. NVHA intends to deploy the following
4 initiatives, as further described in Nevada’s RHT grant application:
1. **Make Rural Nevada Healthy Again** – Through implementing the **Rural
Health Outcomes Accelerator Program (RHOAP)**, Nevada plans to invest 15%
of the annual award in efforts that promote value-based and innovative
care models that prevent and manage chronic disease. This includes (but not
limited to) new online collaborative care strategies, remote and/or hybrid
approaches to care, online patient health management tools, and virtual
provider mentorship programs. 2. **Strengthen Rural Health Systems** – The
Nevada Health Authority will introduce the **Flex Fund for Nevada’s Rural
Providers**, planning to bolster and modernize the state’s rural health care
infrastructure with 20% of the annual award in new investments in items like
technology, equipment, supplies, mobile units, emergency services, etc. The
State will encourage rural providers to leverage their regional buying power
through regional purchasing strategies and sharing arrangements. 3. **Create a
Robust Network of Health Providers in Rural Nevada** – Through establishment
of the **Workforce Recruitment and Rural Access Program**, Nevada plans to
address historic gaps in the state’s rural workforce. Multiple strategies
will be employed with the proposed support of 40% of the annual award to
address immediate and long-term provider gaps, including new incentives
for providers to live and serve in rural areas of the state, tuition aid
with commitments to serve rural Nevada, and a rural physician residency
program. 4. **Fill the “Unfillable” Gaps with Innovative Technology
Solutions** – The Nevada Health Authority plans to implement the **Rural
Health Innovation and Technology Grant** with 15% of the annual award toward
innovative technologies and modernization of health data and records systems
with a focus on alignment with the CMS Digital Health Ecosystem and addressing
cybersecurity needs for rural health systems. These funds may also be used
to bolster the state’s rural telehealth infrastructure.
