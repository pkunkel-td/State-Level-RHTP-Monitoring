Transformation Project =================================== Building a Stronger,
Healthier Rural South Dakota -------------------------------------------------
South Dakota is one of the most rural states in the country, and that
creates unique healthcare challenges. Many rural and frontier residents
travel long distances to reach care, face limited transportation
options, and experience provider shortages. These challenges can
lead to higher rates of suicide, chronic disease, and preventable
health conditions. To help address these needs, the South Dakota
Department of Health has launched the Rural Health Transformation
Project. This five-year initiative focuses on strengthening healthcare
systems in rural communities and ensuring that access to quality care
is available statewide. [Gov. Rhoden and DOH Secure $189.4 million for Rural

Summary") ### Our Vision Every South Dakotan deserves access to safe,
high-quality care close to home. This project is designed to make
rural healthcare more sustainable, connected, and resilient for the
long term. Four Focus Areas ---------------- Connecting Technology and
Data ------------------------------ We are upgrading health information
systems to improve coordination, planning, and delivery of care. * Expand
certified Electronic Health Record (EHR) systems * Integrate statewide Health
Information Exchange * Invest in telehealth equipment and cybersecurity *
Launch a Rural Data Atlas to support data-driven decision-making Advancing
the Rural Workforce ----------------------------- We are supporting the
healthcare professionals and frontline workers who keep our rural communities
healthy. * Offer incentives to recruit and retain healthcare providers
* Expand Community Health Worker training and certification * Create a
Training and Resource Hub for continuing education Keeping Healthcare Local
and Strong ----------------------------------- We are making it easier for
South Dakotans to get care without leaving their communities. * Develop new
Medicaid payment models to support rural facilities * Award Rural Health
Access and Quality Grants for facility upgrades * Expand chronic disease
and maternal health programs Transforming Systems for Sustainability
--------------------------------------- We are improving care delivery
by integrating behavioral and physical health and strengthening emergency
care. * Expand Certified Community Behavioral Health Clinics (CCBHCs) * Use
collaborative care models to integrate behavioral health into primary care
* Establish regional Emergency Medical Services (EMS) hubs ### Community
Conversations: Listening to South Dakotans The South Dakota Department of
Health held community conversations in five locations: Aberdeen, Eagle
Butte, Pierre, Rapid City, and Yankton. These meetings helped identify
the key healthcare challenges and opportunities in rural areas of the
state. Participants highlighted issues such as workforce shortages, limited
access to dental and behavioral health services, transportation barriers,
and the need for affordable, local care. Common solutions included expanding
telehealth and mobile clinics, improving broadband access, supporting rural
provider recruitment programs, and developing community-based transportation
and wellness initiatives. The feedback gathered from these discussions is
guiding efforts to strengthen healthcare access and delivery for all South
Dakotans, regardless of where they live. * Access to healthcare is limited
in many rural communities * There are not enough healthcare workers across
fields * Transportation is a major barrier to receiving care * Mental and
behavioral health needs are growing * Dental care is difficult for many
residents to access * Telehealth can help but requires better internet and
tools * Cost and insurance challenges prevent needed care * Some groups such
as seniors, youth, and Native communities face added barriers ### About
the Rural Health Transformation Program The Rural Health Transformation
(RHT) Program was established under the federal One Big Beautiful Bill Act
(Public Law 119-21, Section 71401). It is a one-time, nationwide initiative
by the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) to strengthen rural
healthcare delivery systems. The program provides $50 billion in funding over
five years (FY 2026–2030) to support state-led strategies for improving
access, innovation, and sustainability in rural health. Each state can apply
for funding through cooperative agreements, with funds directed toward: *
Expanding rural healthcare access and strengthening local health systems
* Recruiting and retaining healthcare providers * Increasing telehealth
and technology infrastructure * Improving behavioral and mental health
services * Developing innovative and sustainable care delivery models
Strategic Goals --------------- The program is guided by five strategic
goals: ---------------------------------------------- 1. **Improve
rural health and wellness** Promote prevention and manage chronic
disease 1. **Ensure sustainable healthcare access** Strengthen local
provider networks 1. **Develop the workforce** Recruit, retain, and
expand provider capacity in rural areas 1. **Encourage innovation**
Support new care models and flexible payment systems 1. **Leverage
technology** Expand telehealth, data sharing, and cybersecurity tools ![Image

### Why This Matters Together, these goals create a more connected, capable,
and resilient rural health system to improve access, quality, and outcomes for
all South Dakotans. ### Stay Connected This project is not just about immediate
improvements. It is a long-term investment in the health and resilience of
South Dakota’s rural communities. As the project moves forward, we will
continue sharing updates, resources, and stories from the people and providers
making a difference. Have questions or want to get involved? [Contact
