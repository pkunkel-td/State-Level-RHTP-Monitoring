Transformation (RHT) Program is part of the H.R.1 budget reconciliation
bill. The RHT Program offers $50 billion funding nationwide to improve
rural health care. The Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS)
administers the program. So far, CMS awarded Washington state about $181
million for year 1 of the program. These funds will support the hospitals,
clinics, and providers that rural families rely on every day. The Health
Care Authority (HCA), Department of Health (DOH), and Department of Social
and Health Services (DSHS) — in support of Governor Ferguson’s Office
— partnered to develop and run Washington state’s RHT plan. Next steps
The funding award is close to our application budget of $200 million. Our
next step is to revise the budget to account for the difference. We’re
carefully making budget changes that trim — but don't eliminate — funding
allotments. CMS requires the revised budget by January 30 and will review
it within 30 days. After that, we’ll review a cooperative agreement with
CMS. More about the program The RHT Program provides $10 billion annually
for fiscal years (FYs) 2026–2030, and states have two years to spend each
year’s funding. Every approved state will receive the same amount, with
additional funds distributed by CMS based on a state’s rural population,
rural health facilities, and other factors. To apply for the program,
CMS required states to submit a $200 million budget per year. CMS awarded
Washington $181 million for year 1 of the program. Once the program begins,
states will have yearly budget reconciliation with CMS to update program
plans based on allocated funds. Washington’s plan Washington’s plan for
the RHT Program is detailed in these key parts of our program application:
Project narrative: A full description of our proposed RHT Program plan and the
most important part of the application. Project summary: A one-page summary
of our proposed RHT Program plan. Governor’s endorsement: A letter from
Governor Ferguson expressing his support for our proposed RHT Program plan. The
materials shared here were reformatted from the submitted version so they’re
easier to read. All wording matches the original documents. Washington’s
RHT plan includes six initiatives to help build a healthier, more resilient,
and financially sustainable rural health system. While the project narrative
details each initiative, here’s a summary: Initiatives Input from people in
Washington We asked for public input to help shape our state’s strategy for
implementing the RHT Program. We reached out through this webpage, email,
and social media. We also had in-depth discussions with various groups
interested in the RHT Program. The community reached back with over 300
written responses. We’ll continue to partner with the public as the RHT
Program moves forward. Who we heard from What we heard Resources Materials
