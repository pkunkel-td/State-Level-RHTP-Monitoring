The program’s plan was developed with input from a core team, including Governor’s Office staff, ADECA, the Alabama Department of Finance, the Alabama Medicaid Agency, and the Alabama State Health Planning and Development Agency. Following federal guidelines, ADECA submitted the state’s application and plan on November 5, 2025, to the Center for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) and is awaiting federal review and approval.
