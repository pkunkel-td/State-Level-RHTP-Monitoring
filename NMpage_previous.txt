Rural Health Transformation Program -----------------------------------
**Latest News for Providers and Communities** * New Mexico was awarded
**$211,484,741 for Federal Fiscal Year 2026 (FFY26**) through the CMS
Rural Health Transformation (RHT) Program to support implementation of the
state’s five approved RHT initiatives. * The Health Care Authority (HCA)
and CMS will meet to discuss **next steps for implementation,**including
implementation timelines, reporting expectations, allowable expenditures,
technical assistance supports, and finalization of a revised budget aligned
with New Mexico’s award amount and organizational structure. * HCA will
**fill new job positions** to oversee and carry out RHT initiatives. *
HCA will finalize **implementation milestones, procurement timelines,
and opportunities for provider and community engagement**. * HCA will
develop Requests for Proposals (RFPs) to distribute funding to rural health
communities, including establishment and support of the **Rural Health
Sustainability and Innovation Center (RHSIC)**. **Overview** The RHT Program
(authorized under H.R. 1, Public Law 119-21, Section 71401) is a $50 billion
federal initiative to strengthen rural health care and help rural communities
improve access, quality, equity, and sustainability of health services. Over
the next five years (FY 2026-2030), CMS will distribute **$10 billion**
per year to awarded states to help improve access, quality, workforce, and
sustainability of health care in rural communities. Total funding available
will be allocated via two mechanisms: * $25 billion distributed equally among
all states with an approved application * $25 billion distributed based on
competitive scoring and rural factors While funding will be allocated to
all approved states, there is no guarantee that all state applicants will be
awarded. Once allocated, states are anticipated to engage a combination of
vendors, health care providers, and other community partners to implement
approved initiatives. **RHT Application Requirements:** The application
must include: * Rural health transformation plan with goals delineated
in H.R. 1, * Strategies to manage long-term financial solvency for rural
hospitals, * Identification of specific causes driving the accelerating
rate of standalone rural hospitals becoming at risk of closure, conversion,
or service reduction, * A plan to use the funds to carry out three or more
permitted activities. Each state must propose **three or more**activities
it plans to pursue through the Rural Health Transformation Program from the
following list: 1. Recruit and retain clinical workforce talent to rural
areas, with a 5-year commitment, 2. Provide payments to providers for health
care items or services, 3. Develop projects that support innovative models of
care (value-based care, alternative payments), 4. Promote sustainable access
to high quality rural health care services, 5. Assist rural communities
to right size their health care delivery systems (preventative, ambulatory,
pre-hospital, emergency, acute inpatient care, outpatient care, and post-acute
care services), 6. Support access to opioid use disorder treatment, substance
use treatment, and mental health service, 7. Provide training and technical
assistance to develop and adopt technology-enabled solutions to improve care
delivery in rural hospitals (remote monitoring, robotics, AI), 8. Provide
technical assistance, software, and hardware for IT advances to improve
efficiency, enhance cybersecurity capacity, and improve health outcomes,
9. Promote consumer-facing, technology-driven solutions for the prevention
and management of chronic diseases, or 10. Promote evidence-based, measurable
intervention to improve prevention and chronic disease management. For more
details on national program goals, visit CMS’s [**Rural Health Transformation
homepage**](https://www.cms.gov/priorities/rural-health-transformation-rht-program/rural-health-transformation-rht-program?utm_source=chatgpt.com).
**What This Means for New Mexico** * New Mexico must create a Rural
Health Transformation Plan by fall 2025. * With endorsement from the
Governor, HCA intends to apply for this opportunity to bring federal
resources to our rural counties and support the providers and communities
who care for them. * If awarded, funding will be used to expand rural
health services, stabilize critical access hospitals and clinics, grow
workforce, and introduce technology solutions intended to improve care
and coordination. * The HCA is working with the Governor’s Office
and state agencies to collaborate with partners, stakeholders, health
councils, tribal leaders, and others to understand: * The needs of rural
communities, * Opportunities to lay the foundation for a sustainable,
high-quality rural health care delivery system. **Stakeholder Engagement**
To build a strong New Mexico application, HCA released**[a Request for
Information(RFI)](https://www.hca.nm.gov/wp-content/uploads/NM-HCA-RHTP-RFI-26-630-8000-0011.pdf)**
