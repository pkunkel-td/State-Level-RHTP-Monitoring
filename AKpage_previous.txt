Application and proposed initiatives ------------------------------------
As part of its application, Alaska proposed six statewide initiatives that
reflect ideas and feedback from hundreds of organizations and community
partners. These initiatives outline how Alaska could use RHTP funds to improve
access to care, strengthen the workforce, support healthier communities,
and transform Alaska’s health care delivery systems. The six proposed
initiatives are: 1. **Healthy Beginnings:** Investing in maternal and child
health to help Alaskan families start strong 2. **Health Care Access:**
Expanding and maintaining access to essential health services in rural,
remote, and frontier communities 3. **Healthy Communities:** Promoting healthy
lifestyles and investing in preventive care 4. **Pay for Value:**Fiscal
Sustainability: Pursuing innovative payment models to build a stronger,
more sustainable health care system 5. **Strengthen Workforce:**Growing and
supporting skilled, resilient health care teams across Alaska 6. **Spark
Technology & Innovation:**Updating technology and infrastructure to improve
care and drive innovation You can view the program summary and proposed
initiatives document here: [Alaska RHTP Project Narrative and Supporting
Documents](https://health.alaska.gov/media/bxangqdz/alaska-rhtp-project-narrative-and-supporting-documents.pdf)
Background: Alaska’s Collaborative Approach
------------------------------------------- To prepare Alaska’s RHTP
application, DOH gathered input from across the state through a Request for
Information (RFI) issued in summer 2025. * The Department received responses
from 160 outside groups, including over 400 project ideas and suggestions. *
77% of respondents are either located in Alaska or have worked here before. *
36% of respondents were health care providers (including Tribal health
providers). * Other respondents included health technology companies (15%),
health consulting firms (15%), and patient advocates (11%). Fewer responses
came from community organizations, trade groups, schools, government agencies,
and public officials. (Note: Responses from DOH teams and advisory boards
were collected separately.) Ideas from these responses helped shape the six
initiatives included in Alaska’s final RHTP application. You can read the RFI
Response Detailed Summary here: [RFI Response Detailed Summary - September 19,
2025](https://health.alaska.gov/media/5uqmv3jz/rfi-response-detailed-summary-9192025_ss.pdf)

"Ak Rhtp Initiatives 20251010") ### Rural Health Transformation Program
Frequently Asked Questions #### What is the Rural Health Transformation Program
(RHTP)? View The RHTP is a new federal program created by Congress in 2025
to improve rural health care across all fifty states. It provides $50 billion
over five years for states to support better access to care, stronger health
systems, and healthier communities. Half of the funds are split evenly across
all approved states, and the other half is distributed based on how rural
the state is and the quality of the state’s RHTP application. Alaska
is among the top recipients nationwide, reflecting the state’s
significant rural population, geographic challenges, and long-standing
health care access needs. In each year of the program, Al[aska will receive
$272,174,856](https://www.cms.gov/newsroom/press-releases/cms-announces-50-billion-awards-strengthen-rural-health-all-50-states)
to support targeted, system-level investments aimed at improving access to
care while reinforcing the long-term stability of Alaska’s health care
infrastructure. #### What is the goal of RHTP? View The goal of RHTP is
to help make health care work better for all Alaskans by improving access
and prevention, expanding workforce, leveraging technology, and creating
long-lasting changes that help people stay healthy. The program encourages
innovation, strengthens local, regional and statewide partnerships, supports a
robust hub-and-spoke health care delivery model, and builds a more sustainable
and connected statewide health system that serves all Alaskans. #### Can RHTP
funds support projects anywhere in Alaska? Can organizations in Anchorage,
Fairbanks, and other hub communities apply? View Yes! Organizations anywhere
in Alaska will be able to apply. Although the program is designed to improve
health in rural, remote, and frontier regions, Alaska’s health system is
deeply interconnected. Many rural residents receive care in regional hubs
and larger communities. Projects based in urban areas can improve rural
health outcomes. If a project supports the RHTP goals, strengthens the
health care system, or supports the health of rural Alaskans in any way,
it may be eligible for funding. #### Who can apply for RHTP funding? View
Many types of organizations will be eligible for RHTP funding, including
but not limited to: * Health care providers * Tribes and Tribal Health
Organizations * Hospitals and clinics * Behavioral health and substance use
treatment organizations * Emergency Medical Services (EMS) and emergency
care entities * Social service organizations * Local governments * Health
workforce and training programs * Technology and innovation partners *
Schools, universities, vocational and other education partners * Child
care providers and early childhood development programs * Provider and
trade associations * Other nonprofits or community-based organizations
working on health or community well-being #### What can RHTP funds be used
for? View RHTP funds will support a wide range of innovative projects that
fit within Alaska’s six initiatives, which can be found in the [RHTP Project
Narrative](https://health.alaska.gov/media/bxangqdz/alaska-rhtp-project-narrative-and-supporting-documents.pdf
"Alaska RHTP Project Narrative and Supporting Documents"). Examples
include: * Expanding access to primary, maternal, behavioral, specialty,
or oral health care * Training, recruiting, or retaining health workers *
Upgrading clinics, EMS resources, or health care settings * Strengthening
value-based care and innovative payment models * Launching new mobile or
itinerant services * Investing in telehealth, interoperability, and digital
health tools * Community wellness programs and prevention partnerships *
Technology that improves coordination, safety, or data sharing RHTP funds may
support costs associated with project planning, capacity-building activities,
and project start-up, but cannot be used for ongoing program support or
operating expenses. Each project will need to attest to a sustainability
plan beyond the five-year span of RHTP funding. #### What can RHTP funds
not be used for? View Federal rules do not allow funds to be used for certain
expenses, including but not limited to: * Services already covered by Medicaid,
Medicare, or other payers * The non-federal share (state match) of Medicaid
services * New direct student loans, or repaying existing student loans *
Major construction projects * Duplicating/replacing funding for existing
programs * Activities already paid for by another federal grant * Broadband
infrastructure * Activities not aligned with Alaska’s RHTP initiatives
When it is time for organizations in Alaska to apply, applicants will need to
show how their project aligns with RHTP program goals, and explain how their
project does not duplicate other funding. More information about allowable
and unallowable uses of funds will be shared when CMS awards RHTP grants to
states in late 2025. #### Is Alaska’s RHTP Project Narrative final? View No,
Department of Health (DOH) submitted Alaska’s RHTP application on November
4, 2025 and it is currently under federal review. The RHTP is a cooperative
agreement, and CMS may work with DOH to adjust the RHTP goals, initiatives,
and potential uses of funding that are outlined in the application posted
above. #### How will the program be administered? View DOH is the lead
agency for Alaska’s RHTP. DOH will work with federal partners at CMS to
set program priorities, approve awards, and ensure federal compliance. DOH
will establish a statewide Subrecipient Administrator to help run the
application process within the state, provide technical help to applicants,
process awards, and support reporting and compliance. All funding decisions
will be made by the DOH Commissioner with support from the RHTP Advisory
Council. #### When can organizations apply? View Alaska will open its first
application cycle in 2026 after federal awards are announced. DOH encourages
organizations to prepare now by: * Reviewing [Alaska’s RHTP Project
Narrative](https://health.alaska.gov/media/bxangqdz/alaska-rhtp-project-narrative-and-supporting-documents.pdf
"Alaska RHTP Project Narrative and Supporting Documents") * Thinking about
projects to propose, including timeframes for projects and plans to sustain
projects after RHTP funding ends * Identifying any partners for your project(s)
* Coordinating with other entities in your region * [Signing up for RHTP
updates](https://public.govdelivery.com/accounts/AKDHSS/signup/48430)
* Gathering basic financial and program documentation More details,
timelines, and instructions will be posted on this website as soon as
they become available. #### How will applications be reviewed? Will the
criteria be public? View Yes. DOH is committed to a transparent, fair,
and consistent review process. Every application will be reviewed for
eligibility and completeness, then scored by Alaska’s RHTP Advisory
Council. DOH will post the full scoring rubric and review criteria
online so applicants know exactly what reviewers are looking for. Final
funding award decisions will be made by the DOH Commissioner. ####
