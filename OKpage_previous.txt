**Oklahoma has officially secured $223.5 million for the first year of
a five-year grant through the Rural Health Transformation (RHT) Program,
part of a historic $50 billion federal investment authorized by the One Big
Beautiful Bill Act.** **The five-year program focuses on helping people
get the care they need where they live, leading to a healthier, thriving
state.** What happens next? ------------------ With funding now awarded,
Oklahoma will begin phased implementation of RHTP initiatives across the
state. Updates will be shared on this page as programs launch and more
information becomes available. Read below to learn what the program means
for our state as Oklahoma begins this work. ### Quick Links [RHTP Application

Previous Next #### You don’t have to repeat your story every time you see
a doctor. When clinics, hospitals and specialists use connected records,
your test results, medications and history move with you. That means smoother
visits, fewer repeat tests and safer care, even if you need help outside your
hometown. ### Care moves faster when it matters most. For stroke, pregnancy
complications or mental health emergencies, quick action saves lives. These
investments help rural hospitals connect instantly with specialists so
treatment can begin right away. ### Getting to appointments is easier. New
ride scheduling tools and local driver programs make it simpler to get to
care, helping people keep appointments and stay on track with follow-up
visits. ### More care is available close to home. Services like behavioral
health care, high-risk pregnancy support and more are available locally
through telehealth, shared staff and better technology. ### Communities gain
more doctors, nurses and counselors. These programs train local students,
bring providers to rural towns and support them in staying long term,
leading to shorter waits and stronger relationships with care teams. ###
Health care spending works smarter. By sharing services, buying together and
focusing on value-based care, clinics can operate more efficiently, helping
local hospitals stay stable and care remain affordable. ### Pregnant moms
and babies get extra support. Tools like home blood pressure monitoring,
telehealth with specialists and better care coordination help spot concerns
early and support healthy pregnancies and births. ### Schools and kids are
supported. Investments in physical education, school-based health services
and Medicaid billing help schools promote student health while keeping
resources focused on learning. ### Local hospitals stay strong. With better
staffing, technology and coordination, rural hospitals are better positioned
to keep their doors open, support local jobs and continue serving their
communities. ### Bottom line: For people living in rural Oklahoma, this means
easier access to care, simpler visits, faster help in emergencies and more
services available nearby. 1. You don’t have to repeat your story every time
you see a doctor. 2. Care moves faster when it matters most. 3. Getting to
appointments is easier. 4. More care is available close to home. 5. Communities
gain more doctors, nurses and counselors. 6. Health care spending works
smarter. 7. Pregnant moms and babies get extra support. 8. Schools and kids
are supported. 9. Local hospitals stay strong. 10. Bottom line: What does
RHTP mean for Oklahoma? --------------------------------- This funding brings
new resources to rural communities statewide. It supports easier access
to care, stronger community partnerships, more local health workers and
modern technology that helps providers connect and coordinate. If you live
in rural Oklahoma, this initiative shows up in real, everyday ways: * Care
is available closer to home * Access to care is easier with ride assistance,
mobile clinics, and virtual visits * Emergencies are treated faster * Pregnant
moms and babies get extra support closer to home * Behavioral health services
are easier to access * Local hospitals and clinics are more likely to stay
open and will operate with new technology #### Make rural America healthy
again Support rural health innovations and new access points to promote
preventative health and address root causes of diseases. Projects will use
evidence-based, outcomes-driven interventions to improve disease prevention,
chronic disease management, behavioral health, and prenatal care. ####
Sustainable access Help rural providers become long-term access points for
care by improving efficiency and sustainability. With RHT Program support,
rural facilities work together—or with high-quality regional systems—to
share or coordinate operations, technology, primary and specialty care,
and emergency services. #### Workforce development Attract and retain
a high-skilled health care workforce by strengthening recruitment and
retention of healthcare providers in rural communities. Help rural providers
practice at the top of their license and develop a broader set of providers
to serve a rural community’s needs, such as community health workers,
pharmacists, and individuals trained to help patients navigate the healthcare
system. Who benefits? ------------- Oklahoma envisions a future where every
community—no matter how small or remote—has access to high-quality,
locally grounded care that is connected through technology, supported by
regional collaboration, and sustained by a strong rural workforce. Rural
healthcare will remain financially stable, driven by innovation, and resilient
for future generations. #### Innovative care Spark the growth of innovative
care models to improve health outcomes, coordinate care, and promote flexible
care arrangements. Develop and implement payment mechanisms incentivizing
providers or Accountable Care Organizations (ACOs) to reduce health care
costs, improve quality of care, and shift care to lower cost settings. ####
Tech innovation Foster use of innovative technologies that promote efficient
care delivery, data security, and access to digital health tools by rural
facilities, providers, and patients. Projects support access to remote
care, improve data sharing, strengthen cybersecurity, and invest in emerging
technologies Oklahoma’s Six RHTP Initiatives -------------------------------
These areas reflect required federal programming and are the foundation
of the state’s transformation plan. Details about each initiative
and programs receiving funding can be viewed in the [RHTP Initiatives Summary
Packet.](https://oklahoma.gov/content/dam/ok/en/health/health2/aem-documents/health-promotion/rhtp/RHTP_InitiativeFundingSummary.pdf)
1. Innovating the Care Model 2. Moving Upstream 3. Growing the Next-Gen of
Rural Talent 4. Facilitating Regional Collaboration 5. Shifting to Value
6. Building Health Data Utility ### Innovating the Care Model Bringing
care closer to home. This includes telehealth, transportation support,
expanded care teams and investments in local health infrastructure. ###
Moving Upstream Strengthening community-led prevention and wellness. This
includes chronic disease prevention and management programs and supports that
help people stay healthy. ### Growing the Next Generation of Rural Talent
Building a stronger workforce pipeline. This includes “grow your own”
initiatives, training placements and recruitment efforts that bring more
providers to rural communities. ### Facilitating Regional Collaboration
Helping local partners share resources and work together on operations,
technology and coordinated care. ### Shifting to Value Supporting the
transition to value-based care through technical assistance, infrastructure
development and quality incentive programs. ### Building Health Data Utility
Investing in technology that improves data sharing and care coordination,
including EHR upgrades, interoperability and advanced analytics tools. How
Oklahoma Shaped the Plan ---------------------------- The RHTP plan reflects
extensive outreach across the state to better understand needs, priorities
and opportunities. **Engagement included:** * More than 400 responses to
a statewide Request for Information * Four listening sessions in regional
communities * Input from provider and professional associations * Tribal
consultation with more than 60 representatives * Over 40 interviews with
rural providers, educators, community groups and experts * A cross-agency
State Steering Committee that guided strategy and alignment Local
voices highlighted clear challenges: limited workforce, technology gaps,
transportation barriers, chronic disease pressures and the need for more
coordinated care. These insights shaped every part of Oklahoma’s application
and final plan. ### Committed to Long-Term Sustainability RHTP is a five-year
federal investment, but Oklahoma has designed every initiative with long-term
impact in mind. **Sustainability strategies include:** * Billable services
* Provider-assumed costs * Ongoing government funding * Private funding *
One-time payments that support durable improvements The goal is for communities
to benefit long after this federal grant period ends, achieving a true rural
health transformation. This funding has been awarded through the Rural Health
Transformation Program (RHTP), a national initiative created under H.R. 1,
the One Big Beautiful Bill Act. For more information visit the [CMS RHTP
