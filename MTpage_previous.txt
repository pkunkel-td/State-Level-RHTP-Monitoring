Program](https://dphhs.mt.gov/index) 2. RHTP Rural Health Transformation
Program =================================== Governor Greg Gianforte and
Department of Public Health and Human Services (DPHHS) Director Charlie
Brereton announced in December 2025 a historic $233 million investment
from the Trump administration to stabilize and modernize rural health
care delivery throughout Montana. Awarded by the Centers for Medicare &
Medicaid Services' (CMS) Rural Health Transformation Program (RHTP), these
funds will support improving Montana’s rural health care providers
in delivering sustainable, high-quality affordable care. This award
reflects the first-year award of a five-year federal grant program, with
Montana currently set to receive up to $1.2 billion over the life of the
program. The announcement follows the [successful approval of Montana’s
application](https://dphhs.mt.gov/assets/RuralHealthTransformation/RHTP-Plan.pdf)
to CMS, which was submitted by DPHHS in November 2025. The state received
the fourth-highest funding award among all 50 states, signaling the quality
and strength of Montana’s application. First RHTP Stakeholder Advisory
Committee meeting ------------------------------------------------- The
RHTP Stakeholder Advisory Committee was established to provide guidance
to DPHHS to support effective implementation of the RHTP initiatives. The
committee’s first meeting is Thursday, Jan. 22, from 10 am to 4 pm at
Montana State University (MSU) in Bozeman. This session will focus on
project goals and gathering public feedback. However, no funding decisions
will be made. While open to the public, some portions of the meeting will
be closed. **Registration for the meeting is required**. For [registration,
meeting details, agenda, directions, and parking information, visit the
ORH website](https://healthinfo.montana.edu/rhtpkickoff.html). Funding
information ------------------- CMS requires states to submit revised budgets
aligned with announced awards by January 30. DPHHS is currently adjusting
its budget to prioritize high-impact programs with the capacity to absorb
additional funding. Once the budget is finalized, most funds will be awarded
through competitive bidding at [bids.mt.gov](https://bids.mt.gov/). Other
methods include grant applications or inter-agency contracts (e.g., with the
Department of Labor & Industry). All funding opportunities will be announced at
[ruralhealth.mt.gov](https://ruralhealth.mt.gov/)as they become available. Next
Steps ---------- DPHHS will collaborate with rural providers, hospitals,
community organizations, and other health care stakeholders to deliver five
core initiatives tailored to Montana's rural health care challenges. The
[five core initiatives](https://dphhs.mt.gov/ApprovedRHTPInitiatives
"https://test-dphhs.mt.gov/RuralHealthTransformationProgram/ApprovedRHTPInitiatives")
are: 1. Workforce Development 2. Sustainable Access
3. Innovative Care Models 4. Community Health and Prevention
5. Technology Innovation For questions about this project, please

Background Established by President Trump’s Working Families Tax Cuts
legislation, the RHTP provides up to $50 billion nationally through 2030 to
help states stabilize, transform, and restructure rural health systems and
support essential health care providers with sustainability. H.R. 1, enacted
on , established a federal $50 billion Rural Health Transformation Program
(RHTP) to stabilize and strengthen rural health care delivery systems,
including hospitals and other providers. To receive funding from the RHTP,
states had to submit a rural health transformation plan to CMS. In November
2025, Montana applied for funding from the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid
Services (CMS), and on Dec. 29, 2025, DPHHS was awarded a historic $233
million in funds to stabilize and modernize rural health care delivery
throughout Montana. DPHHS will now allocate funds to eligible entities in
accordance with Montana’s approved rural health transformation plan. Prior
to submitting the plan, DPHHS conducted several weeks of public outreach to
Montana’s hospitals, over 20 rural health stakeholders, all eight tribal
nations and Urban Indian Organizations, and other state agencies. DPHHS
also integrated feedback from a 900-registrant webinar and over 300 formal
responses to an agency-led Request for Information. The plan reflects this
input. H.R. 1 created a $50 billion fund for states with an approved rural
health transformation plan, with $10 billion available per year from FFY 2026
through FFY 2030. Half of the funding will be split evenly between states
with an approved transformation plan, and the other half will be distributed
to states at CMS’ discretion based on each state’s rural population,
rural health facilities, and other CMS-defined characteristics. [Rural

**SAC**- Stakeholder Advisory Committee What are the main goals of Montana’s
Rural Health Transformation Program (RHTP)? Montana’s vision is to ensure
that every resident has affordable access to high-quality, high value care
regardless of geography. The State’s RHTP plan directly addresses the root
causes of rural health disparities through five integrated initiatives that
strengthen the workforce, secure financial solvency, modernize care delivery,
embed prevention and community health at the center of care, and expand
technology use. Who is eligible to apply for funding under Montana’s
RHTP? Eligibility will be defined for each funding opportunity and may
vary by initiative. Expected eligible entities may include tribal nations
and tribal organizations, local and state government organizations, health
care providers, educational institutions, nonprofits, and other partners
with the capacity to implement rural health initiatives. How do I apply
for funding? The State is still early in the process of determining how
it will disperse RHTP funding. The State received funding to implement the
specific initiatives in Montana’s application. We are currently developing
plans for distributing funds related to each individual initiative or
sub-initiative. Those fund distribution plans will need to follow state
procurement rules. For most of the initiatives, this will mean a competitive
procurement managed through the bids.mt.gov website. In other instances,
it might be a government-to-government contract with another state agency
(for example, the Department of Labor & Industry) or a grant application
process. Communities and providers may be able to apply directly for funding
for certain initiatives. We will announce this if funding opportunities of this
kind become available at [ruralhealth.mt.gov](https://ruralhealth.mt.gov/) and
via the newsletter. How will applications be reviewed and funding decisions
be made? Each funding or procurement opportunity will specify the applicable
review criteria and selection process, consistent with Centers for Medicare
& Medicaid Services (CMS) requirements (e.g., rural impact, feasibility,
sustainability, and budget effectiveness). How is "rural" defined by the CMS
and within the Notice of Funding Opportunity (NOFO)? How does this affect
initiatives? CMS defines “rural” according to the Health Resources and
Services Administration (HRSA), which defines 51 of Montana’s 56 counties
as non-metropolitan. Certain census tracts within the five remaining
counties (Cascade, Gallatin, Lewis and Clark, Missoula, and Yellowstone)
may be considered rural, as well. Initiatives must focus on rural health
but need not exclude non-rural regions. Initiatives in non-rural areas
that significantly impact rural health are also allowed. Can organizations
located in non-rural or urban areas apply for RHTP funding? Yes, if their
work demonstrably benefits rural communities. Implementation must focus
on rural health but do not need to exclude non-rural regions when impact
on rural communities is clear. Are Montana's RHTP initiatives submitted in
the Project Narrative final? Yes. The initiatives submitted by Department
of Public Health and Human Services (DPHHS) on Nov. 5 are final, and the
award announced by CMS directly funds these initiatives. Per CMS and the
NOFO, states may not add or remove initiatives after submission. However,
the state may adjust funding allocations, goals, and timelines within each
approved initiative. What is the Rural Health Center of Excellence (CoE) and
what will it do? The CoE is a time-bound program within the second initiative
_(link to initiatives)_, that will develop and oversee the implementation of
data-backed recommendations to support the financial sustainability and care
delivery transformation of rural health facilities. These recommendations
will be tailored to the individual needs of participating facilities. The
CoE will offer an opt-in program for rural health systems, providing
financial incentives to support the implementation of transformation plans
developed in partnership with the CoE. For more information, please reference
Montana’s RHTP Project Narrative. In the award period, when must funds
be used? How will DPHHS pass funds from the federal government onto local
governments and organizations? What happens when the funding ends? The RHTP
is broken into five award budget periods, with funds transferred to the
State once each year. Awarded funds must then be used by the conclusion
of the following budget period. Otherwise, they will be redistributed to
other states. Funding can be distributed as subawards or subcontracts to
other organizations and entities to execute initiatives with strong State
oversight. The State has not yet made decisions about specific subawards
or subcontracts. There is a strong emphasis within the RHTP on sustainable
initiatives and their lasting impact, which extends beyond the five-year
funding period. What restrictions are outlined by the CMS in the NOFO as to
how funds can be used? CMS outlines that funding cannot be used to cover
many specific costs, including construction or major building projects,
supplanting existing funding streams, cosmetic upgrades, independent
research costs, and telecommunications equipment flagged under federal
law. There are many other restrictions that CMS details on pages 18 through
22 in the NOFO, which can be referenced for a comprehensive view. [Additional
restrictions](https://www.cms.gov/files/document/rural-health-transformation-frequently-asked-questions.pdf)
are described in the PDF on the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services
website. How will stakeholders engage with Montana’s RHTP? RHTP is designed
to incorporate ongoing stakeholder input through multiple complementary
channels: * **Stakeholder Advisory Committee (SAC):** A standing advisory
body representing rural, tribal, provider, and partner perspectives; provides
structured input on RHTP implementation, priorities, and emerging issues; meets
bi-annually, with materials and summaries shared publicly when appropriate. The
SAC does not have any decision-making authority. The SAC will be convened by
the Montana Office of Rural Health. * **CoE Board:**A time-bound board that
will ensure impacted stakeholders have representation and take part in the
decision-making of the CoE. * **Ongoing Engagement:** * **RHTP Website:**
This will be the central source for program updates, timelines, and key
documents (including procurement information). * **RHTP Email Inbox:** This
inbox will a dedicated channel for questions, feedback, and stakeholder
input. * **RHTP Newsletter:** The newsletter will include periodic updates
on progress, milestones, and upcoming engagement opportunities. Collapse
