and Department of Public Health and Human Services (DPHHS) Director
Charlie Brereton announced in December 2025 a historic $233 million
investment from the Trump administration to stabilize and modernize
rural health care delivery throughout Montana. Awarded by the Centers for
Medicare & Medicaid Services' (CMS) Rural Health Transformation Program
(RHTP), these funds will support improving Montana’s rural health care
providers in delivering sustainable, high-quality affordable care. This
award reflects the first-year award of a five-year federal grant program,
with Montana currently set to receive up to $1.2 billion over the life of
the program. The announcement follows the [successful approval of Montana’s
application](https://dphhs.mt.gov/assets/RuralHealthTransformation/RHTP-Plan.pdf)
to CMS, which was submitted by DPHHS in November 2025. The state received
the fourth-highest funding award among all 50 states, signaling the quality
and strength of Montana’s application. First RHTP Stakeholder Advisory
Committee meeting ------------------------------------------------- The
RHTP Stakeholder Advisory Committee was established to provide guidance
to DPHHS to support effective implementation of the RHTP initiatives. The
committee’s first meeting is Thursday, Jan. 22, from 10 am to 4 pm at
Montana State University (MSU) in Bozeman. This session will focus on
project goals and gathering public feedback. However, no funding decisions
will be made. While open to the public, some portions of the meeting will
be closed. **Registration for the meeting is required**. For [registration,
meeting details, agenda, directions, and parking information, visit the
ORH website](https://healthinfo.montana.edu/rhtpkickoff.html). Funding
information ------------------- CMS requires states to submit revised budgets
aligned with announced awards by January 30. DPHHS is currently adjusting
its budget to prioritize high-impact programs with the capacity to absorb
additional funding. Once the budget is finalized, most funds will be awarded
through competitive bidding at [bids.mt.gov](https://bids.mt.gov/). Other
methods include grant applications or inter-agency contracts (e.g.,
with the Department of Labor & Industry). If direct funding opportunities
for communities and providers become available, they will be announced at
[ruralhealth.mt.gov](https://dphhs.mt.gov/RuralHealthTransformationProgram/ApprovedRHTPInitiatives).
Next Steps ---------- DPHHS will collaborate with rural
providers, hospitals, community organizations, and other
health care stakeholders to deliver five core initiatives
tailored to Montana's rural health care challenges. The [five core
initiatives](https://dphhs.mt.gov/RuralHealthTransformationProgram/ApprovedRHTPInitiatives
"https://test-dphhs.mt.gov/RuralHealthTransformationProgram/ApprovedRHTPInitiatives")
are: 1. Workforce Development 2. Sustainable Access
3. Innovative Care Models 4. Community Health and Prevention
5. Technology Innovation For questions about this project, please

**SAC**- Stakeholder Advisory Committee Montana aims to provide all residents
with affordable, high-quality care regardless of geography. The State’s
RHTP plan tackles rural health disparities through five core initiatives:
workforce development, sustainable access, innovative care models, community
health and prevention, and technology innovation. Eligibility varies by
initiative, but typical applicants include tribal nations, government
agencies, health care providers, educational institutions, nonprofits, and
other partners capable of implementing rural health projects. The State is
currently designing its RHTP fund distribution plans, which must comply with
state procurement rules. Most initiatives will involve competitive bidding via
[bids.mt.gov](https://bids.sciquest.com/apps/Router/PublicEvent?CustomerOrg=StateOfMontana),
while others may use government-to-government contracts with another
state agency (for example, the Department of Labor and Industry) or grant
applications. If direct funding opportunities for communities and providers
become available, they will be announced at ruralhealth.mt.gov. Each funding
opportunity will specify review criteria and selection processes aligned
with Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) requirements, such as
rural impact, feasibility, sustainability, and budget effectiveness. CMS uses
Health Resources and Services Administration (HRSA) standards, classifying
51 of Montana’s 56 counties as non-metropolitan. Specific census tracts
within the five metropolitan counties (Cascade, Gallatin, Lewis and Clark,
Missoula, and Yellowstone) may also qualify. While initiatives must focus
on rural health, they can include non-rural areas if they significantly
benefit rural populations. Yes, provided the work demonstrably benefits
rural communities. Initiatives must focus on rural health but can include
non-rural regions if the rural impact is clear. Yes. The Department of
Public Health and Human Services (DPHHS) initiatives submitted on Nov. 5,
2025 are final and funded as awarded. Per CMS rules, initiatives
cannot be added or removed, though the state may adjust
funding, goals, and timelines within them. [Part of the second
initiative](https://dphhs.mt.gov/RuralHealthTransformationProgram/ApprovedRHTPInitiatives),
the CoE is a time-bound program providing data-backed, tailored recommendations
to improve rural health facility sustainability and care delivery. Facilities
can opt in to receive financial incentives for implementing
these transformation plans. For details, see [Montana’s RHTP Project
Narrative.](https://dphhs.mt.gov/RuralHealthTransformationProgram/ApprovedRHTPInitiatives)
The Rural Health CoE Governing Board is expected to serve as the oversight
and decision-making body for the Rural Health CoE. In that role, the CoE
Governing Board may provide facility-specific optional recommendations
to participating hospitals, informed by data, best practices, and rural
health expertise. The RHTP Stakeholder Advisory Committee (SAC) will serve
in an advisory role, offering input and perspectives from a broad range of
stakeholders. However, it will not have decision-making authority or issue
recommendations to individual facilities. The Department will finish appointing
members to the Rural Health CoE Governing Board over the next few months,
subject to the timing of Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services’ (CMS)
budget approval. The Department aims to balance rural health experience with
subject-matter expertise to ensure a qualified, representative board. The
RHTP receives annual funding over five budget periods. Funds must be used
by the end of the following period or they will be redistributed to other
states. While Montana may distribute funds via subawards or subcontracts to
execute initiatives, specific decisions have not yet been made. All efforts
prioritize sustainability and impact beyond the five-year grant term. CMS
prohibits using RHTP funds for construction, major building projects,
cosmetic upgrades, independent research, or restricted telecommunications
equipment. Additionally, funds cannot supplant existing funding streams. For
a complete list of restrictions, see pages 18–22 of the NOFO and the [CMS
FAQ](https://www.cms.gov/files/document/rural-health-transformation-frequently-asked-questions.pdf).
RHTP incorporates stakeholder input through three main channels: *
**Stakeholder Advisory Committee (SAC):** Convened by the Montana Office
of Rural Health, the SAC represents rural, tribal, provider, and partner
perspectives; provides structured input on RHTP implementation, priorities,
and emerging issues; meets bi-annually, with materials and summaries shared
publicly when appropriate. The SAC does not have any decision-making
authority. * **CoE Board:** A time-bound group ensuring impacted
stakeholders participate in CoE decision-making. * **Ongoing Engagement:**
* **Website:** Central hub for updates, timelines, and procurement. *
**Email Inbox:** Dedicated channel for direct feedback and questions at
[HHSRuralHealthTransformation@mt.gov](mailto:HHSRuralHealthTransformation@mt.gov).
