Program](https://dphhs.mt.gov/index) 2. Index Rural Health Transformation
Program =================================== Governor Greg Gianforte and
Department of Public Health and Human Services (DPHHS) Director Charlie
Brereton announced in December 2025 a historic $233 million investment
from the Trump administration to stabilize and modernize rural health
care delivery throughout Montana. Awarded by the Centers for Medicare &
Medicaid Services (CMS) Rural Health Transformation Program (RHTP), these
funds will support improving Montana’s rural health care providers
in delivering sustainable high-quality affordable care. This investment
reflects the first-year award of a five-year federal grant program, with
Montana currently set to receive up to $1.2 billion over the life of the
program. The announcement follows the [successful approval of Montana’s
application](https://dphhs.mt.gov/assets/RuralHealthTransformation/RHTP-Plan.pdf)
to CMS, which was submitted by DPHHS in November 2025. The state received
the fourth-highest funding award among all 50 states, signaling the
quality and strength of Montana’s application. **Next Steps** DPHHS will
collaborate with rural providers, hospitals, community organizations, and
other health care stakeholders to deliver five core initiatives tailored
to Montana's rural health care challenges. The five core initiatives
are **Workforce Development,****Sustainable Access**, **Innovative
Care Models**, **Community Health and Prevention**, and **Technology
Innovation**. DPHHS will now submit a revised budget to CMS that aligns
with the award and partner with the Montana Office of Rural Health to host
biannual RHTP Advisory Committee meetings, ensuring ongoing input from the
public. The first RHTP Advisory Committee meeting will be Thursday, Jan. 22,
2026 at Montana State University. For questions about this project, please

Summary](https://dphhs.mt.gov/assets/RuralHealthTransformation/RHTP-Project-Summary.pdf)
Background Established by President Trump’s Working Families Tax Cuts
legislation, the RHTP provides up to $50 billion nationally through 2030 to
help states stabilize, transform, and restructure rural health systems and
support essential health care providers with sustainability. H.R. 1, enacted
on , established a federal $50 billion Rural Health Transformation Program
(RHTP) to stabilize and strengthen rural health care delivery systems,
including hospitals and other providers. To receive funding from the RHTP,
states had to submit a rural health transformation plan to CMS. In November
2025, Montana applied for funding from the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid
Services (CMS), and on Dec. 29, 2025, DPHHS was awarded a historic $233
million in funds to stabilize and modernize rural health care delivery
throughout Montana. DPHHS will now allocate funds to eligible entities in
accordance with Montana’s approved rural health transformation plan. Prior
to submitting the plan, DPHHS conducted several weeks of public outreach to
Montana’s hospitals, over 20 rural health stakeholders, all eight tribal
nations and Urban Indian Organizations, and other state agencies. DPHHS
also integrated feedback from a 900-registrant webinar and over 300 formal
responses to an agency-led Request for Information. The plan reflects this
input. H.R. 1 created a $50 billion fund for states with an approved rural
health transformation plan, with $10 billion available per year from FFY 2026
through FFY 2030. Half of the funding will be split evenly between states
with an approved transformation plan, and the other half will be distributed
to states at CMS’ discretion based on each state’s rural population,
rural health facilities, and other CMS-defined characteristics. The plan
had to describe how the state will use program funds to: * Improve access to
hospitals, other health care providers, and health care items and services
furnished to rural residents of the state; * Improve health care outcomes for
rural residents; * Prioritize the use of new and emerging technologies that
emphasize prevention and chronic disease management; * Initiate, foster, and
strengthen local and regional strategic partnerships between rural hospitals
and other health care providers to promote measurable quality improvement,
increase financial stability, maximize economies of scale, and share best
practices in care delivery; * Enhance economic opportunity for, and the
supply of, health care clinicians through improved recruitment and training
strategies; * Prioritize data- and technology-driven solutions that help rural
hospitals and other rural health care providers furnish high-quality care as
close to patients’ homes as possible; * Outline strategies to manage the
long-term financial solvency and operating models of rural hospitals in the
state; and * Identify specific factors driving the increasing rate of closures,
conversions, or service reductions among stand-alone rural hospitals. Funds
must be used for three or more of the allowable activities, including: *
Promoting evidence-based, measurable interventions to improve prevention and
chronic disease management; * Providing payments to health care providers for
furnishing health care items or services, as specified by the Administrator;
* Promoting consumer-facing, technology-driven solutions for the prevention
and management of chronic conditions; * Providing training and technical
assistance to support the development and adoption of technology-enabled
care delivery models—such as remote monitoring, robotics, artificial
intelligence, and other advanced technologies; * Recruiting and retaining
clinical workforce talent in rural areas, with a minimum five-year service
commitment to rural communities; * Providing technical assistance, software,
and hardware to support significant information technology advancements that
enhance efficiency, cybersecurity, and patient health outcomes; * Assisting
rural communities in right-sizing their health care delivery systems by
identifying appropriate service lines—including preventative, ambulatory,
pre-hospital, emergency, acute inpatient, outpatient, and post-acute care
services; * Supporting access to opioid use disorder treatment services, other
substance use disorder treatments, and mental health services; * Developing
projects that support innovative models of care, including value-based care
arrangements and alternative payment models, as appropriate; and * Supporting
additional uses that promote sustainable access to high-quality rural health
care services, as determined by the Administrator. RHTP Public Webinar
