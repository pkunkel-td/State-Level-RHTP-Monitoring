Kansas Received $221 Million for Rural Health Transformation Plan
-----------------------------------------------------------------
[Kansas was awarded $221
Million](https://www.governor.ks.gov/Home/Components/News/News/876/55)from
the [Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services
(CMS)](https://www.cms.gov/newsroom/press-releases/cms-announces-50-billion-awards-strengthen-rural-health-all-50-states
"https://www.cms.gov/newsroom/press-releases/cms-announces-50-billion-awards-strengthen-rural-health-all-50-states")
to support the first year of the Rural Health Transformation Program. This
funding award exceeds the base amount states allocated and reflects
the quality of Kansas’ application. You can read the full RHTP
application [here](https://www.kdhe.ks.gov/DocumentCenter/View/52810
"https://www.kdhe.ks.gov/documentcenter/view/52810"). Background: -----------
H.R. 1 Section 71401 of the One Big Beautiful Bill Act (OBBBA), enacted into
law on July 4, 2025, establishes the Rural Health Transformation Program (RHTP)
and created a national $50 billion fund, to support this initiative. All
50 states are eligible to apply for this funding. The Centers for Medicare
& Medicaid Services (CMS) will establish an application process and due
date. Additionally, CMS must approve or deny applications no later than
December 31, 2025. Applications are required to be submitted in early November
2025. Purpose: -------- The Kansas Department of Health and Environment
(KDHE) is seeking public comment to inform the state’s strategic approach
to applying for and implementing the RHTP. KDHE is committed to pursuing an
approach that is both expeditious and effective, directing limited resources
to high-need areas with a focus on sustaining critical, high-quality health
care access and services for rural Kansas. Required Program Components and
Eligible Activities: ----------------------------------------------------
The RHTP application must address the following outcomes: * Improve access
to hospitals and other providers for rural residents and health care items
and services furnished to rural residents * Improve health care outcomes
of rural residents * Prioritize use of new and emerging technologies that
emphasize prevention and chronic disease management * Initiate, foster,
and strengthen local and regional strategic partnerships between rural
hospitals and other providers to promote measurable quality improvement,
increase financial stability, maximize economies of scale, and share
best practices in care delivery * Enhance economic opportunity for and the
supply of health care clinicians through enhanced recruitment and training *
Prioritize data and technology driven solutions that help rural providers
furnish health care services as close to the patient’s home as possible *
Improve management of long-term financial solvency and operating models
of rural hospitals. ### States must use RHT Program funds for three or
more of the approved uses of funds: * Promoting evidence-based, measurable
interventions to improve prevention and chronic disease management. * Providing
payments to health care providers for the provision of health care items or
services, as specified by the Administrator. * Promoting consumer-facing,
technology-driven solutions for the prevention and management of chronic
diseases. * Providing training and technical assistance for the development
and adoption of technology-enabled solutions that improve care delivery
in rural hospitals, including remote monitoring, robotics, artificial
intelligence, and other advanced technologies. * Recruiting and retaining
clinical workforce talent to rural areas, with commitments to serve rural
communities for a minimum of 5 years. * Providing technical assistance,
software, and hardware for significant information technology advances
designed to improve efficiency, enhance cybersecurity capability development,
and improve patient health outcomes. * Assisting rural communities to right
size their health care delivery systems by identifying needed preventative,
ambulatory, pre-hospital, emergency, acute inpatient care, outpatient care,
and post-acute care service lines. * Supporting access to opioid use disorder
treatment services (as defined in section 1861(jjj)(1)), other substance
use disorder treatment services, and mental health services. * Developing
projects that support innovative models of care that include value-based care
arrangements and alternative payment models, as appropriate. * Additional
uses designed to promote sustainable access to high quality rural health
care services, as determined by the Administrator. RHT virtual meeting
