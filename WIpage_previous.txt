Rural Health Transformation Program
=================================== The [Rural Health Transformation
Program](https://www.cms.gov/priorities/rural-health-transformation-rht-program/overview)
is a federal funding opportunity provided to states through the
Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS). The Wisconsin
Department of Health Services (DHS) received a [first-year award from
CMS](https://www.cms.gov/newsroom/press-releases/cms-announces-50-billion-awards-strengthen-rural-health-all-50-states)
for $203,670,005 to invest in rural capacity, sustainability, and innovation
across three major initiatives: * **Strengthen the rural health care
workforce** Recruiting and retaining an adequate health care workforce
is a challenge in rural areas, making access to quality, timely care for
rural residents difficult. This funding will provide grants for innovative
workforce projects in rural communities, support career pathways for rural
health care providers, and fund services provided by community health
workers. * **Drive rural technology and innovation** Rural Wisconsin
needs the technology to support and reach residents, such as closed-loop
referral systems and telehealth capabilities. This funding will invest in
upgrades to rural provider systems, digital infrastructure, and develop a
digital rural health care collaborative. * **Transform rural care through
partnerships** Rural Wisconsinites experience fragmented coordination
across primary care, specialty care, behavioral health, chronic disease
prevention, and community social supports. This funding will stand up
a competitive grant program for rural regions to create coordinated
systems of care where multi-sector partnerships show a clear path to
sustainability. DHS is in the process of recruiting a team to manage this
project. Information about recruitment opportunities will be posted on the
[DHS careers webpage.](https://www.dhs.wisconsin.gov/job-opps/index.htm)
Timeline -------- DHS will receive federal funding for five years to
implement the initiatives of the program. CMS has not yet announced
award amounts for the subsequent four years of the program. Preparing
for implementation ---------------------------- DHS's [Office of Grants
Management (OGM)](https://www.dhs.wisconsin.gov/ogm/index.htm) will lead
the implementation and oversight of the Rural Health Transformation
Program. This strategic initiative will strengthen DHS’s capacity
to administer large-scale, federally funded programs designed to improve
access to high-quality health care in rural communities across Wisconsin. OGM
plans to recruit a program director to lead a dedicated team responsible for
coordinating grant administration, program reporting, fiscal accountability,
and technical support for statewide partners. Additional staff positions
will be recruited in the coming months to support program operations and
ensure effective management of program resources. This expansion marks
a significant step in advancing DHS’s mission to promote equitable,
efficient, and sustainable health systems throughout Wisconsin. Information
about upcoming recruitment opportunities will be posted on the [DHS careers
webpage](https://www.dhs.wisconsin.gov/job-opps/index.htm) as positions become
available. Materials submitted ------------------- * [Application summary
