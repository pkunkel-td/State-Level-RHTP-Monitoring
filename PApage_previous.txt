Transformation Plan Summary ========================================
[Download PA's Rural Health Transformation
Plan](https://www.pa.gov/content/dam/copapwp-pagov/en/dhs/documents/rural-health/pa-rural-health-transformation-plan.pdf)
Project goals: -------------- Transform rural health through regionally
led, technology-enabled models that strengthen local capacity and sustain
high-quality, evidence-based care driven by continuous learning and
innovation. Total budget amount: -------------------- $200,000,000
per year x 5 years = $1,000,000,000 Sub-Awardee Organizations:
-------------------------- Eight of Pennsylvania’s Partnerships for
Regional Economic Performance regions: Central, South Central, Southern
Alleghenies, Southwest, Northwest, North Central, Northern Tier, Northeast;
PA Area Health Education Center (AHEC); University of Pittsburgh-Medicaid
Research Center; and other state and community partners. Use of RHTP
funds: ------------------ Pennsylvania’s RHTP addresses all five Center
for Medicaid & Medicare Services (CMS) goals: ### 1. Rural Health: We
propose innovations that directly respond to the most pressing health
priorities identified over the past two years by rural stakeholders
through dozens of listening sessions, roundtables, and [regional health
summits](https://www.pa.gov/agencies/dhs/programs-services/healthcare/rural-health/events),
as well as through the state’s rural health improvement plans
and more than 300 responses submitted through our [Rural Health
website](https://www.pa.gov/agencies/dhs/programs-services/healthcare/rural-health)
by stakeholders. Common themes include maternity care, behavioral health,
dental care, aging, and primary and preventive care, areas that have been
shown to reduce chronic disease, provide more years of healthy life, and
decrease reliance on costly hospital care. * * * ### 2. Sustainable Access:
We propose to establish eight regional Rural Care Collaboratives (RCCs)
through Pennsylvania’s Partnerships for Regional Economic Performance
organizations, which lead regional coordination and strategic investment
in economic development. Each RCC will bring together community and health
system partners to prioritize local needs, strengthen shared services, expand
telehealth and clinical integration, and ensure residents have consistent
access to high-quality primary and specialty care. * * * ### 3. Workforce:
Underlying all rural health concerns is the need for significant investments
and innovations in workforce development. We propose expanding the full
spectrum of the rural health care workforce including allied health,
Emergency Medical Services (EMS), nursing, nurse practitioners, physician
assistants, dentists, pharmacists, and physicians through ruralfocused
training programs that target identified gaps in care. This will be
accomplished by upfront scholarships, mentoring, short-term housing,
stipends, and investments in the rural health provider training pipeline,
with five-year rural health service commitments. * * * ### 4. Innovative
Care: We will provide data and analytic support to the RCCs to analyze
the impact of innovative digital models of care delivery, flexible care,
alternative payment models, and “right-sizing” rural hospitals to shift
care to lower cost settings, while improving access to essential health care
services. * * * ### 5. Technological Innovation: We will scale promising
consumer-facing applications, telehealth, technology-enabled, and AI solutions
to improve care and efficiency and lower costs. We will invest in digital
and informational technology infrastructure to allow for clinical integration
of electronic health records (EHRs). * * * [Download PA's Rural Transformation
