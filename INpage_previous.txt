Indiana Rural Health Transformation Program Grant Application Working Group
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
The One Big Beautiful Bill Act includes $50 billion* for a Rural Health
Transformation Program which is a federal relief program to transform
care and improve health outcomes in rural communities. The RHTP Working
Group is a collaborative effort led by the Indiana Family and Social
Services Administration and the Indiana Department of Health with
a goal to engage stakeholders across the state to identify best use
of the funds to meet the objectives of the program. On Dec. 29, 2025,
Indiana was awarded a grant of nearly $207 million for the first year of
a five-year program to address health outcomes in the state’s rural
communities. The funding from the federal Rural Health Transformation
Program will be used to support GROW: Cultivating Hoosier Health to improve
healthcare access, quality and outcomes through system innovation. The
five-year GROW initiative focuses on promoting innovation, strategic
partnerships, infrastructure development, and workforce investment. For more
information, please visit[Indiana’s Rural Health Transformation Program

near future. Results from the rural community health survey can be found
