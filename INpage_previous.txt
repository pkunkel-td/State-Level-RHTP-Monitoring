Beautiful Bill Act includes $50 billion* for a Rural Health Transformation
Program which is a federal relief program to transform care and improve health
outcomes in rural communities. Rural Health Transformation Program will be
available for supporting rural communities to improve healthcare access,
quality, and outcomes through system transformation. The RHT Program focuses
on promoting innovation, strategic partnerships, infrastructure development,
and workforce investment. The RHTP Working Group is a collaborative effort
led by the Indiana Family and Social Services Administration and the Indiana
Department of Health with a goal to engage stakeholders across the state to
identify best use of the funds to meet the objectives of the program. Indiana's
RHTP Application seeks to help rural communities meet these strategic goals:
* **Make rural America healthy again:**Support rural health innovations and
new access points to promote preventative health and address root causes of
diseases. Projects will use evidence-based, outcomes-driven interventions to
improve disease prevention, chronic disease management, behavioral health, and
prenatal care. * **Sustainable access:**Help rural providers become long-term
access points for care by improving efficiency and sustainability. With
RHT Program support, rural facilities work together—or with high-quality
regional systems—to share or coordinate operations, technology, primary and
specialty care, and emergency services. * **Workforce development:**Attract
and retain a high-skilled health care workforce by strengthening recruitment
and retention of healthcare providers in rural communities. Help rural
providers practice at the top of their license and develop a broader set
of providers to serve a rural community’s needs, such as community health
workers, pharmacists, and individuals trained to help patients navigate the
healthcare system. * **Innovative care:**Spark the growth of innovative care
models to improve health outcomes, coordinate care, and promote flexible
care arrangements. Develop and implement payment mechanisms incentivizing
providers or Accountable Care Organizations (ACOs) to reduce health care
costs, improve quality of care, and shift care to lower cost settings. *
**Tech innovation:**Foster use of innovative technologies that promote
efficient care delivery, data security, and access to digital health tools by
rural facilities, providers, and patients. Projects support access to remote
care, improve data sharing, strengthen cybersecurity, and invest in emerging
technologies. For more information, please consult Indiana's [RHTP Project
