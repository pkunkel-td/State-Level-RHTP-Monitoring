by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid to help states “support rural
communities across America in improving healthcare access, quality, and
outcomes by transforming the healthcare delivery ecosystem.” Through
this funding application, Massachusetts seeks to strengthen the rural
health system and ensure every community has access to high-quality,
sustainable care. Vision: A Commonwealth where rural communities thrive,
and well-being is achievable for all. To advance this vision, the Rural
Health Transformation Program proposal focuses on three overarching goals: *
Expand access to essential healthcare services for rural residents. * Improve
health and well-being through targeted initiatives and partnerships. *
Strengthen systems, policies, and investments to meet the unique needs
of rural communities. For additional information on the Federal Rural

**Rural Health Challenges and Opportunities for Transformation**
In Massachusetts, 160 of 350 towns are classified as rural, covering
over half the state’s land and home to roughly 10% of the population
(700,000+), including many vulnerable groups such as seasonal workers,
tribal members, older adults (60+), and low-income families. The DPH
State Office of Rural Health (SORH) defines rural communities based
on federal criteria, population size and density, and the presence of
small or critical access hospitals. Areas are categorized as Rural 1 or
Rural 2 and grouped into 18 rural clusters to guide state policy. [Rural
communities](https://www.mass.gov/doc/rural-definition-detail-0/download)experience
major healthcare disparities in access and outcomes due to limited providers,
aging infrastructure, and systemic decline in local health services. These
areas face higher chronic disease and behavioral health burdens, workforce
shortages, and financial instability, resulting in poorer health outcomes
compared to non-rural regions. Addressing these challenges requires targeted
investments in workforce development, infrastructure, and access to primary
and specialty care. **Massachusetts' Application** Massachusetts [submitted an
application](https://www.mass.gov/doc/rural-health-transformation-program-summary)
to the Rural Health Transformation Program through the Executive Office of
Health and Human Services (EOHHS). EOHHS led an interagency team to develop
the application, including the Massachusetts Department of Public Health
(DPH), the Massachusetts Medicaid program (MassHealth), DPH’s Office of
Rural Health, the Massachusetts Executive Office of Economic Development’s
Office of Rural Affairs, and input from other agencies throughout state
government. Through longstanding relationships with key stakeholders and
pre-established processes and groups to support direct engagement, the team
held early engagement sessions with our state’s rural hospitals, rural
federally qualified health centers (FQHCs), rural social service organizations,
rural community-based organizations, and the Massachusetts Rural Council
on Health. Additionally, the Commonwealth facilitated direct input for the
application from trade associations, as well as organizations representing
local administrators and municipalities throughout rural Massachusetts. To
ensure broad opportunities for input from throughout the Commonwealth, EOHHS
also posted a public Request for Information, which received responses from
rural organizations, healthcare providers, social service organizations,
rural municipalities, technology companies, expert consultants, non-profits,
businesses, and educational providers. The RHTP application reflects a broad
spectrum of input from partners across the state and is structured around
seven Initiatives, each of which contains numerous activities, to transform
rural healthcare in Massachusetts: 1. Population Health Advancement: Improve
clinical infrastructure, increase coordination and expand payment methodologies
to advance rural health providers’ value-based care and efforts to lower
cost and increase quality of care. 2. Innovation in Rural Care Models:
Facilitate the introduction and redesign of models in rural Massachusetts to
increase access, broaden service availability, and improve efficiencies in the
delivery of health care. 3. Training Healthcare for Retention, Innovation,
& Excellence (THRIVE): Strengthen the full continuum of the healthcare
workforce in rural communities with targeted activities focused on workforce
development, recruitment, and retention. 4. Healthy Rural Communities: Support
community-informed and led prevention activities to increase opportunities and
address gaps related to the root causes of health. 5. EMS Service Integration:
Investments and programs to increase viability, integration, and expand
role of EMS in rural communities. 6. Enhancing Technology Interoperability
and Connectivity: Improving technological infrastructure of rural health
providers to increase connectivity, create efficiencies, and support better
outcomes. 7. Facility Modernization & Re-Use: Support minor renovations of
rural facilities to optimize space and expand access. Following submission,
EOHHS is awaiting additional feedback from our federal partners on our
application, including how much funding may be awarded to the Commonwealth. If
Massachusetts is awarded funding through the RHTP, these Initiatives will
represent a substantial investment in improving rural health services across
the Commonwealth. We invite all stakeholders to join us in this effort and
to stay informed about progress and opportunities for engagement. As we move
forward with the Rural Health Transformation Program, we will continue to
seek input and feedback.
