About the Rural Health Transformation Program (RHTP)
----------------------------------------------------
The [Rural Health Transformation Program
(RHTP)](https://www.cms.gov/priorities/rural-health-transformation-rht-program/overview)
was established through H.R.1, the federal budget reconciliation bill signed
into law on . In addition to introducing long-term changes to Medicaid and SNAP
funding, H.R.1 created this five-year program to support rural health system
transformation across the United States. The program is administered by the
**Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS)** and will provide funding to
selected states from **Federal Fiscal Year 2026 through 2030.** All 50 states
were eligible to apply. To be considered for funding, states were required
to submit a comprehensive application, aligning with the [Federal Notice of
Funding Opportunity (NOFO)](https://grants.gov/search-results-detail/360442)
by . Oregon’s Application Status --------------------------- We are excited
to announce that Oregon has received its official Notice of Award from
CMS on , for the Rural Health Transformation Program grant (RHTP). Oregon
has been awarded $197.3 million for the program's first year in 2026. The
Oregon RHTP team looks forward to partnering with rural communities and
CMS to implement this initiative. We look forward to improving access
to high-quality, reliable care and supporting long-term improvements
in health outcomes for rural communities across the state. * [CMS Press

Rural Health Transformation Program: Allowable Use of Funds
---------------------------------------------------------------------
​See [RHTP Notice of Funding
Opportunity](https://grants.gov/search-results-detail/360442)
(NOFO) and latest [CMS
FAQs](https://www.cms.gov/files/document/rural-health-transformation-frequently-asked-questions.pdf)
for more information. ### **General:** * Per the NOFO and CMS FAQs, there are
no limits on the types of entities that may receive funds. Each state has
the discretion to determine which organizations receive funds, based on
parameters outlined here. * Oregon will direct funding to rural and frontier
areas of the state. Any spending in urban areas must be clearly demonstrated
to be for the benefit of rural patients. * Rural is any geographic areas in
Oregon ten or more miles from the center of a population center of 40,000
people or more. Frontier (or “remote") is any county with six or fewer
people per square mile. * See the [Oregon Office of Rural Health map of rural
areas](https://www.ohsu.edu/media/881) in the state as a helpful guide. *
RHTP funds are designed to support new access points and expansion of services
to rural communities, not to replace or duplicate existing funding sources. *
RHTP funds may only be applied to the costs associated with new populations,
new activities, new program milestones, etc. when used to: * expand an existing
pilot program or initiative or * develop new training programs with existing
partners. * The maximum individual salary amount that can be billed to the
RHTP is $225,700. If, for any reason, the person working on this program makes
over the salary cap amount, the remaining salary must be covered by other
funding sources. #### **Allowable:** Public Law 119-21, Section 71401 (i.e.,
[H.R.1](https://www.congress.gov/bill/119th-congress/house-bill/1/text))
includes details on statutorily approved uses of funds and unallowable
expenses. States must spend their RHTP funds on at least three permissible
uses. Oregon submitted an application that strategically covers all permissible
uses (see [NOFO](https://grants.gov/search-results-detail/360442) for detailed
definitions): * Prevention and chronic disease * Provider payments * Consumer
tech solutions * Training and technical assistance * Workforce * IT advances
* Appropriate care availability * Behavioral health * Innovative care *
Capital expenditures and infrastructure * Fostering collaboration ​Certain
use-of-fund categories are subject to specific restrictions. Please see
sections “Provider Payments," “Workforce," “Capital Expenditures and
Infrastructure," and “IT Advances" in this FAQ for more detail on each
respective use of funds category. Generally, gas costs are allowable. For
example, providing fuel stipends for rural patients while establishing other
transportation. #### **Not allowable:** Funding cannot be used… * To pay
for meals, including: * food costs for community meetings for programming
related to outcomes of the grants in the program, or * medically tailored
meals, in schools (or in any other context) because it is an ongoing
cost. * To replace or modify payment for clinical services that could be
reimbursed by insurance, another form of health coverage or under current
waiver initiatives that are eligible for reimbursement. * On any aspects of
projects or initiatives that are currently funded (or planned to be funded)
via other sources. * For costs incurred pre-award, lobbying activities,
and expenses that are the legal responsibility of another federal, State or
tribal program such as education or vocational rehabilitation services. * For
cost of independent research and development, including their proportionate
share of indirect costs. ### **Provider Payments** Definition: Provider
payments are payments made to health care providers for the provision
of health care items or services. These payments cannot replace payments
for clinical services that could be reimbursed by insurance and/or other
programs. Provider payments are limited to 15% of the total funding CMS
awards a state in a given budget period. #### **Allowable** * Payments to
providers for performance in alterative payment models tied to outcomes. *
Payments to providers for services that are not paid by insurers but support
the strategic goals of the RHTP and tie to a specific initiative. #### **Not
allowable:** RHTP dollars cannot fund… * Uncompensated care that is not
tied to a specific initiative within the RHTP. * Clinician salaries or wage
supports for facilities where the clinician or beneficiaries are subject
to a noncomplete agreement. This does not disqualify facilities that have
clinician non-competes from receiving RHTP funding for other activities. *
Make payments to providers that are not tied to specific quality improvements
or an RHTP initiative, enhanced payment rates for currently billable services
without ties to outcomes, uncompensated care that is not tied to a specific
initiative within the RHTP. ### **Workforce Use of Funds**​ Definition:
Recruiting and retaining clinical workforce talent to rural areas, with
commitments to serve rural communities for a minimum of 5 years. Clinical
workforce talent encompasses a variety of healthcare professionals who
directly provide or support patient care. Examples include clinicians,
allied health professionals, behavioral health providers, non-clinician
providers, and clinical support staff. Training programs could be run
by organizations including but not limited to trade schools, community
colleges, high schools, colleges, universities, technical institutes,
and academic medical centers. #### **Five-year work requirement:** *
Members of the clinical workforce who benefit from recruiting and retention
activities (including incentives) under the RHTP must make a minimum 5-year
commitment to serve rural communities. Generally, if a program offers a
structured, certifiable pathway to a new degree, new certification, or to
a career/new job opportunity in the clinical workforce in a rural area,
the 5-year service requirement will apply. * The five-year commitment
cannot be fulfilled via telehealth services. Any clinicians recruited or
retained under this use of funds must be physically located in rural areas. *
Generally, clinicians would not be held to a 5-year commitment for receiving
non-degree courses or one-off training sessions. * Workforce recruitment
and retention programs focused on K-12 populations are typically excluded
from the minimum 5-year workforce commitment requirement, but it depends
on the nature of the program. Initiatives such as career exploration camps,
mentoring programs, or high school health career clubs that are considered
upstream pipeline activities would not be subject to the minimum 5-year
workforce requirement. Their purpose is to foster interest and exposure,
not to provide the direct, career-enabling training that the commitment is
designed to apply to. Any determination to apply the 5-year commitment to a
K-12 population program will be made on a case-by-case basis by CMS. ####
**Allowable:** * Payment for student or trainee housing is allowable but
limited to short-term (less than 6 months) housing for rotations. * Salaries
or payments to clinicians directly related to new or expanded workforce
development initiatives provided the clinical workforce employee commits to
five years of service.​ #### **Not allowable:** * Student loans or loan
repayment are not an allowable use of funds. * Funds are not intended to
be used for international clinical workers and therefore cannot be used to
recruit and/or sponsor visas for physicians or clinical workers from other
countries. * Funds cannot be used to make payments to providers that are
not tied to specific quality improvements or an RHTP initiative, enhanced
payment rates for currently billable services without ties to outcomes,
uncompensated care that is not tied to a specific initiative within
the RHTP. * Funds cannot be used to directly fund workforce development
initiatives where the clinician or beneficiaries are subject to a noncomplete
agreement. (For example, a new clinician in a rural area because of a funding
workforce development initiative.) This does not disqualify facilities
that have clinician non-competes from receiving RHTP funding. ### **Capital
Expenditure and Infrastructure Spending:** Definition: Investing in existing
rural health care facility buildings and infrastructure, including minor
building alterations or renovations and equipment upgrades to ensure long-term
overhead and upkeep costs are commensurate with patient volume. * Purchase of
equipment will generally fall in this spending category (e.g. exam chairs,
dental equipment). Personal-use equipment like heart rate monitors would
not be in this category. * There is a 20% limitation across Oregon's entire
award per budget period for capital infrastructure expenditures. OHA staff
will be looking at planned infrastructure spending across all initiatives
to ensure this cap is not exceeded. #### **Allowable:** * Renovations and
minor alternations are allowable, within certain parameters and require prior
approval from CMS. Minor alterations and renovations projects include small
modifications aimed at enhancing the functionality of the facility where
the project will take place. In general, minor modifications to an existing
building footprint, existing infrastructure, and existing rooms within a
facility would be considered minor building alterations or renovations. * For
example, renovations or retrofitting to convert underutilized cost intensive
spaces within existing health care facilities to clinic or community-based
treatment spaces would be allowable. * Hypothetical examples include: interior
modifications to create new meeting space, upgrading lighting fixtures,
replacing vents and thermostats for better climate control, accessibility
improvements, security and safety including security cameras or access
control panels. * The existing building being renovated does not have to
be an existing healthcare facility. * A minor renovation may be considered
a minor alteration even if local building regulations require the work to
be permitted. * Initiatives that focus on developing the infrastructure for
healthy living, such as funding the infrastructure necessary to facilitate
nutrition improvement programs at schools in rural communities is an allowable
expense. * Funding may be used to purchase vehicles but will be reviewed on
a case-by-case basis by CMS and approval is not guaranteed. * Playgrounds for
movement-based initiatives will be reviewed on a case-by-case basis by CMS. *
Installations of paths or walking trails will be reviewed on a case-by-case
basis by CMS. * Bike paths and walking trails are generally not allowable
expenses as they may be considered construction. * Minor alterations to
existing paths and trails, however, may be allowable expenses, if they: *
are part of a specific comprehensive initiative that is within the scope
of this program, * have a focus on benefits to rural communities, and *
will be sustainable beyond the life of the program. #### **Not allowable:**
* New construction or major building expansions are not an allowable use of
funds. * Demolition of aged buildings is not an allowable use of funds. *
Use of funds for broadband infrastructure is not an allowable use of funds. *
Construction or building expansion, purchasing or significant retrofitting of
buildings, cosmetic upgrades, or any other cost that materially increases the
value of the capital or useful life as a direct cost is not allowable. ###
**IT Advances:** Definition: Providing technical assistance, software, and
hardware for significant information technology advances designed to improve
efficiency, enhance cybersecurity capability development, and improve patient
health outcomes. * There is a 5% limitation across Oregon's entire award
for funding the replacement of an Electronic Medical Record (EMR) system if
a previous Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health
(HITECH) Act certified EMR system is already in place as of . Replacement
refers to the purchase of a completely new EMR system to take the place of
an existing one. * Upgrades, enhancements, and added modules, interfaces,
or functionality to existing EMR/EHR systems are allowable uses of
funds and are not subject to the 5% limitation. #### **Allowable:** *
Telehealth capabilities and infrastructure are allowable. * Hotspots will
be reviewed by CMS on a case-by-case basis. #### **Not allowable:** *
Funds cannot be used for broadband infrastructure. ​ Frequently Asked
Questions: -------------------------------------- Please note this FAQ
section will be updated regularly as more questions are asked. * General *
Application and award * Use of funds and limitations * Program eligibility
* Program design ### **General** **What are considered administrative
costs? Is there a cap?**​ According to Section 71401 of Public Law 119-21
([H.R.1​](https://www.congress.gov/bill/119th-congress/house-bill/1/text)),
no more than 10% of the amount allotted to a State for a budget period may
be used for administrative expenses, including indirect administrative
costs. This cap is cumulative and applies to the administrative costs
across the entire budget, including administrative costs incurred by
both the awardee and any subrecipient.​​ **Generally, administrative
costs** are defined as general administration and general expenses such as

multiple projects and not easily separated. Expenses included in the indirect
cost pool must not be charged as direct costs. ​**What programmatic and
personnel costs fall under the 10% administrative cap?**​ It depends on
the nature of the activities performed, not the employment structure. CMS
has communicated that it will depend upon the type of work that is being
done as reflected in the State's budget justification, and it will assess
on a case-by-case basis. **Examples of costs that fall under the cap:**
* Audits and audit-like programs directly associated with oversight of
this program and associated funding. * Outside evaluator collecting data
and evaluating the program for the lead agency. * An accountant hired to
keep track of RHT Program funds. **Examples of costs that would not fall
under the cap:** * Outside evaluator hired to directly carry out program
activities, such as conducting a needs assessment for rural areas that
is a core component in one of a state's initiatives. * Hiring preceptors
and purchasing equipment to facilitate training residents. Generally,
if the staff person or contractor is directly related to implementing /
executing / delivering activities described within specific initiatives,
they would not be considered an administrative cost even if they are
employed by the state.​ ### **** ### **Application and award** **When
was Oregon's application to CMS submitted?** * Oregon met the CMS deadline
of , by submitting its application on .​ **Is Oregon's application to CMS
public?** * The most up-to-date information is available on OHA's RHT Program
[webpage](https://www.oregon.gov/oha/HPA/HP/Pages/rural-health-transformation.aspx),
including a project summary, a project narrative, a budget narrative, a letter
to OHA partners and a letter of support from Gov. Tina Kotek for the state's
application. **When will the state know if they are awarded funding?** * CMS is
required by law to issue awards by . Before then, states will undergo budget
negotiations and may be asked to rescale initiatives and eliminate certain
use of funds that are deemed unallowable or exceed spending limits set in the
Notice of Funding Opportunity (NOFO). **How much funding is Oregon expecting
to receive?** * Although OHA submitted the application budget for $200,000,000
per CMS's requirements, it is unclear whether and how much CMS will award
to Oregon the first budget year. Awards will be made to each approved state
based on numerous criteria that can be viewed in the [Notice of Funding
Opportunity](https://grants.gov/search-results-detail/360442) (NOFO). As of ,
CMS has yet to issue award decisions, so the State's application and budget
could be funded in part, in full, or not at all.​ ### **Use of funds and
limitations** **What does "right sizing care availability" mean?**​ *
Right-sizing care availability means aligning the services offered within a
community with that community's needs. We do this by considering a community's
unique needs – in size, scale, and specialty. Right-sizing availability
supports effective and sustainable care. **Can urban organizations receive
funding to run workforce programs, such as residency programs that have
rural rotations?** * Yes.An urban organization can receive funding to
run a workforce program as long as the funded activities impact rural
communities. For example, funding for residency programs should support
rural track programs (RTPs). RTPs give urban programs the opportunity
to partner with rural hospitals, rural ambulatory clinics, and other
non-hospital sites to expand Graduate Medical Education training. ​
**Can funding be used toward existing programs or initiatives?** * There
can be no supplantation or duplication. States can use funds to expand an
existing pilot program or initiative, or to develop new training programs
with existing partners. Funds may only be applied to costs associated with
the new population, new activities, new program milestones, etc. Please
see OHA Allowable Use of Funds for more information, including specific
restrictions for each Use of Funds category. ### **Program eligibility**
**Is funding limited to certain providers or entities?​** Per the NOFO and
CMS FAQs: * Each state has the discretion to determine whether and to whom to
subaward or contract funds. * There are no limits on the types of entities
that may receive funds through the program. Oregon intends to direct funds
to hospitals, health clinics, community health centers, and community-based
organizations providing health care services in rural and frontier
areas statewide. The state will apply the [Oregon Office of Rural Health
(ORH)](https://www.ohsu.edu/sites/default/files/2025-02/ORH_2024YearEndReport%20-%20FINAL.pdf)
definition of rural and frontier to determine eligibility: rural is any
geographic areas in Oregon ten or more miles from the center of a population
center of 40,000 people or more. Frontier (or “remote") is any county with
six or fewer people per square mile. Frontier areas are considered a subset
of rural and are included whenever rural populations are referenced. ###
**Program design** **​** **How does Oregon define rural?** * Rural is any
geographic areas in Oregon ten or more miles from the center of a population
center of 40,000 people or more. Frontier (or “remote") is any county with
six or fewer people per square mile. Frontier areas are considered a subset of
rural and are included whenever rural populations are referenced. **What are
the different distribution pathways?** For Phase 1 (FY26-27) of the program,
Oregon proposed in its application to distribute funds through three pathways:
1. **Catalyst Awards:** Through a Request for Grant Application (RFGA) process,
applicants must apply across the three initiatives (Healthy Communities &
Prevention, Workforce Capacity & Resilience, Technology & Data Modernization)
for ready-to-go projects that can launch immediately or within a couple months
of receiving funding and be implemented within the first two years of the Rural
Health Transformation Program. 2. **Immediate Impact Awards:** Direct awards
for a select set of aligned opportunities identified by the state. There will
not be an application for these awards. 3. **Regional Sustainability Awards:**
Procure a subcontractor(s) to provide facilitation and technical assistance to
organizations developing rural health networks and regional solutions. These
convenings will prepare interested entities for Phase 2 of this distribution
pathway, which will include funding opportunities for applications with
regional solutions for stabilizing rural health care systems. Note: Phase
2 of the program includes additional funding opportunities via Sustained
and Competitive Catalyst Awards with emphasis on collaboration across
organizations. Additional details can be found in the application [budget
narrative](https://www.oregon.gov/oha/HPA/HP/Documents/Oregon%20RHT%20Program%20Application_Budget%20Narrative.pdf).​
**How do we know if our organization is eligible to apply for the Catalyst
Awards?** In our application, Oregon listed a broad range of potential
partners, as there are many types of organizations that provide health
care and social health services to rural communities. While we await CMS
award decisions, OHA is planning the Catalyst Awards and refining the
eligibility criteria to reflect public feedback, areas of greatest need,
and ensure maximum impact of federal funds. Generally, applicants will be
expected to apply to achieve outcomes within **at least one of three possible
initiatives**: 1. Healthy Communities & Prevention 2. Workforce Capacity &
Resilience 3. Technology & Data Modernization **And** must **serve at least
one population** of focus: * Maternal and child health; * Co-occurring BH
conditions; * Individuals aging in place; and/or * Chronic disease.​ **Where
does telehealth activities rank on the list of priorities?** As of December
2025, OHA has not yet ranked eligible activities. OHA strategically identified
all activities proposed under the four state-led initiatives,based on their
role in providing critical support to the aims of each initiative. **Will
the Immediate Impact Awards be awarded competitively?** No. There will not
be an application for these awards. OHA is exploring potential projects
for Immediate Impact Awards. We will prioritize projects that directly
meet the one-year metrics proposed in our RHTP application because CMS
has tied future funding to meeting the previous year's metrics. ​
**What are the reporting requirements?** * ​As required, OHA submitted
a list of outcomes and associated metrics for each initiative in [the project
narrative](https://www.oregon.gov/oha/HPA/HP/Documents/Oregon%20RHT%20Project%20Summary%20and%20Narrative.pdf)
of its application. States will report quarterly and annually on
progress on their work plans, timelines, milestones, and achievement of
measurable outcomes. CMS will use these reports to evaluate compliance
with cooperative agreement terms and a state's progress on its initiatives
and policy commitments. Subgrantees and subcontractors will be required
to track and report on all required metrics in a timely manner
that aligns with federal reporting requirements.​​​​​​
