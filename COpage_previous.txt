The Rural Health Transformation Program (RHTP)
was authorized by [H.R. 1 Section 71401 of Public Law
119-21](https://www.congress.gov/bill/119th-congress/house-bill/1), to
provide grants totaling $50 billion in federal funds from Federal Fiscal Year
(FFY) 2026 through FFY 2030 ($10 billion per year) to States (territories
and Washington D.C. are excluded). The program will be administered by the
Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS), and requires each state to
submit an application and include a “rural health transformation plan”
to the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS). Awards will be
announced no later than December 31, 2025, with funding to states in early
2026. These grants are federal funds only; states will not be required
to provide matching funds to draw down these Rural Health Transformation
federal funds. Colorado’s Application ---------------------- * [Governor’s

Program Funds Structure ---------------------------------------------------
The federal funds include $50 billion that will be allocated to approved States
over five fiscal years and will be split into $10 billion allocations to be
distributed annually from Federal Fiscal Year (FFY) 2026 to FFY 2030. All
50 states are eligible to apply. * Each year, 50% of the $10 billion will
be distributed evenly to all states with an approved application. * The
remaining 50% of the annual funding amount will be allocated by CMS based
on a variety of factors including rural population, the proportion of rural
health facilities in the State, the situation of certain hospitals in the
State, and other factors to be specified by CMS and the Notice of Funding
Opportunity (NOFO), with fund distribution available for no less than 25
percent of approved states. * States are not allowed to use this funding as
a source of state match for additional federal dollars. Timeline -------- *
