**The Department of Health Care Policy & Financing is happy to announce
that Colorado will receive just over $200 million in RHTP grant funds
for the first year of the 5-year program. Please see HCPF’s**[**press
release**](https://hcpf.colorado.gov/newsroom#newsreleases)**for
more information.** The Rural Health Transformation Program
(RHTP) was authorized by [H.R. 1 Section 71401 of Public Law
119-21](https://www.congress.gov/bill/119th-congress/house-bill/1), to
provide grants totaling $50 billion in federal funds from Federal Fiscal Year
(FFY) 2026 through FFY 2030 ($10 billion per year) to States (territories
and Washington D.C. are excluded). The program will be administered by the
Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS), and requires each state to
submit an application and include a “rural health transformation plan”
to the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS). Awards will be
announced no later than December 31, 2025, with funding to states in early
2026. These grants are federal funds only; states will not be required
to provide matching funds to draw down these Rural Health Transformation
federal funds. (NEW) RHTP Advisory Committee Plan Finalized, Apply by Feb
16! -------------------------------------------------------------- In December
and January, HCPF worked with potential grantees, community partners to develop
the Advisory Committee structure for the RHTP grant. In the [overview of the
Committee](https://hcpf.colorado.gov/sites/hcpf/files/RHTP%20Advisory%20Committee%20Memo%20v3.pdf),
it outlines that (the RHTP Advisory Committee will advise HCPF on the
application process, funding priorities, and public-facing materials, provide
input on program developments and CMS negotiations, and offer recommendations
on eligible project types, while HCPF and a third-party facilitator manage and
coordinate the committee’s work. Application scoring and evaluation will be
conducted by an external vendor overseen by HCPF, informed by committee input
and formalized through a future Committee Charter. The [application is now
open](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdVWTJoj1olv31EYlU1890QbFgxg6W8W6MFpfuBfalnO-zL0w/viewform?usp=dialog),

State, and other factors to be specified by CMS and the Notice of Funding

percent of approved states. * States are not allowed to use this funding as
a source of state match for additional federal dollars. Timeline --------
