### Welcome to the new DHHS website! To find the content
you need, please click **Search the Site** located
in the gray bar at the top of all pages, or take a video
tour of our new site. [![Image 5: Introduction to the NEW DHHS Website video

Introduction to the NEW DHHS Website ##### Transcript of video: Welcome to
the new, completely re-designed website for the NH Department of Health and
Human Services. We’ve updated and reorganized the site so that you can find
what you need quickly and easily. This video will show you around, and help
you get familiar with some of the topics available, as well as learn some
accessibility and navigation tips. Starting off, there is this “How Can We
Help You” box, which lists many of our most requested topics. There’s
also a search feature, where you can look for content in both web pages
and documents. This banner section of the website is the same on every
page. Let’s look at what else you can do here. The first accessibility
option is to change text size. Other Accessibility options can be found here,
including making your curser larger, and changing the contrast, text spacing or
font to meet your needs. You can also move the accessibility panel to another
spot on the screen where it makes the most sense for you. You can change
the language of the site to any language supported by Google Translate. In
this middle section of the banner, you’ll find a list of contacts. Please
note that is not a complete employee directory, but rather the key contact
people for various programs and services. You can search by keyword, or see
all the contacts within a particular topic. If you click the “Show All
topics” link, you’ll need to scroll all the way to the bottom to see
the results of your search. The site includes many documents and forms. You
can find lists of pertinent documents within each of the program pages, but
you can also search for any document here. If you’ve come to the site to
report a concern, you can use this link to find the right phone number and
information about making a report. The other thing that appears on every
page is this Escape site button, just in case you need to leave the site
quickly for safety reasons. Now let’s take a look at this main menu. Do
you need directions to a district office or other state building? They are
all listed here, along with our four main facilities. You can search by zip
code, or filter by the specific service you are looking for. Notice that
there are more filter options when you click “load more filters.” When
looking for programs and services you’ll notice that you don’t need to
know the exact name of the program or agency to find it on this site. Use
the programs & services list to narrow your search down by topic. You can
find links for applying for Medicaid or other financial assistance here. And
if you are a business person or employer, there is great information here
about opportunities and resources. Data is in great demand these days, and
you can find all the public data and reports that DHHS produces here. We
have an events calendar for publically available events and meetings, as
well as press releases, public notices and multimedia resources that the
department offers. Finally, way down at the bottom of every page, there’s
a “Submit Feedback” link. We would love to hear from you about your
experience with the site – good or bad! Your suggestions will help make
our new site even more useful for everyone. Thank you for visiting! [Escape
