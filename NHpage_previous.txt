Health Care **December 29, 2025**: The U.S. Centers for Medicare and
Medicaid Services (CMS) has awarded the State of New Hampshire over

Program, the largest award among New England states. Read the full [press

Governor Kelly Ayotte [announced on November 6,
2025](https://www.governor.nh.gov/news/new-hampshire-submits-innovative-plan-transform-rural-health-care)
that the State of New Hampshire’s application for the new

for more information on the State’s planned approach. ### Overview:
The One Big Beautiful Bill Act (Section 71401) This landmark legislation
establishes the Rural Health Transformation Grants Program, administered
by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS). The program
dedicates $50 billion nationwide between 2026 and 2030—an annual
investment of $10 billion. **To access these funds, each state must
submit a Rural Health Transformation Plan to CMS by November 5, 2025.**
For New Hampshire, this means an expected allocation of approximately $100
million per year, totaling $500 million over five years, to strengthen
rural health care access, quality, and long-term sustainability. * [About

### Make Rural America Healthy Again Support rural health initiatives and
new access points to promote preventative health and address root causes of
diseases. Projects will use evidence-based, outcomes-driven interventions
to improve disease management, behavioral health, and prenatal care. ###
Sustainable Access Help rural providers become long-term access points for
care by improving efficiency and sustainability. With RHT Program support,
rural facilities work together - or with high-quality regional systems -
to share or coordinate operations, technology, primary and specialty care,
and emergency services. ### Innovative Care Spark the growth of innovative care
models to improve health outcomes, coordinate care, and promote flexible care
arrangements. Develop and implement payment mechanisms incentivizing providers
or Accountable Care Organizations (ACOs) to reduce health care costs, improve
quality care, and shift care to lower cost settings. ### Technology Innovation
Foster use of innovative technologies that promote efficient care delivery,
data security, and access to digital health tools by rural facilities,
providers, and patients. Projects support access to remote care, improve data
sharing, and strengthen cybersecurity, and invest in emerging technologies. ###
Workforce Development Attract and retain a high-skilled health care workforce
by strengthening recruitment and retention of healthcare providers in rural
communities. Help rural providers practice at the top of their license and
develop a broader set of providers to serve a rural community's needs, such
as community health workers, pharmacists, and individuals trained to help
patients navigate the healthcare system. ### Contact Information List Content
