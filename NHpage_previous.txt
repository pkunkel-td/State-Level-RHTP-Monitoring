The program dedicates $50 billion nationwide between 2026 and 2030—an annual investment of $10 billion. **To access these funds, each state must submit a Rural Health Transformation Plan to CMS by November 5, 2025.** For New Hampshire, this means an expected allocation of approximately $100 million per year, totaling $500 million over five years, to strengthen rural health care access, quality, and long-term sustainability. * [About RHTP](http://www.dhhs.nh.gov/programs-services/medicaid/rural-health-transformation-program/about-rural-health-transformation) * [Rural Health Transformation Project Narrative .pdf](http://www.dhhs.nh.gov/sites/g/files/ehbemt476/files/inline-documents/sonh/rhtc-project-narrative.pdf)![Image 9: .pdf Icon](http://www.dhhs.nh.gov/sites/g/files/ehbemt476/files/styles/inline_icon/public/2019-12/icon-pdf.png?h=e77b622d&itok=QwOzQFit) * [Rural Health Transformation Program Summary .pdf](https://www.dhhs.nh.gov/sites/g/files/ehbemt476/files/documents2/rht-summary.pdf)![Image 10: .pdf Icon](http://www.dhhs.nh.gov/sites/g/files/ehbemt476/files/styles/inline_icon/public/2019-12/icon-pdf.png?h=e77b622d&itok=QwOzQFit) * [CMS Rural Health Transformation Program](https://www.cms.gov/priorities/rural-health-transformation-rht-program/rural-health-transformation-rht-program) * [CMS RHTP Frequently Asked Questions .pdf](https://www.cms.gov/files/document/rural-health-transformation-frequently-asked-questions.pdf)![Image 11: .pdf Icon](http://www.dhhs.nh.gov/sites/g/files/ehbemt476/files/styles/inline_icon/public/2019-12/icon-pdf.png?h=e77b622d&itok=QwOzQFit) * [North Country Rural Health Transformation Summit Presentation .pdf](http://www.dhhs.nh.gov/sites/g/files/ehbemt476/files/documents2/rural-health-summit-09042025.pdf)![Image 12: .pdf Icon](http://www.dhhs.nh.gov/sites/g/files/ehbemt476/files/styles/inline_icon/public/2019-12/icon-pdf.png?h=e77b622d&itok=QwOzQFit) * [Safety Net Healthcare Programs Map .pdf](http://www.dhhs.nh.gov/sites/g/files/ehbemt476/files/inline-documents/sonh/rhtf-map.pdf)![Image 13: .pdf Icon](http://www.dhhs.nh.gov/sites/g/files/ehbemt476/files/styles/inline_icon/public/2019-12/icon-pdf.png?h=e77b622d&itok=QwOzQFit) ### Make Rural America Healthy Again Support rural health initiatives and new access points to promote preventative health and address root causes of diseases. Projects will use evidence-based, outcomes-driven interventions to improve disease management, behavioral health, and prenatal care. ### Sustainable Access Help rural providers become long-term access points for care by improving efficiency and sustainability. With RHT Program support, rural facilities work together - or with high-quality regional systems - to share or coordinate operations, technology, primary and specialty care, and emergency services. ### Innovative Care Spark the growth of innovative care models to improve health outcomes, coordinate care, and promote flexible care arrangements. Develop and implement payment mechanisms incentivizing providers or Accountable Care Organizations (ACOs) to reduce health care costs, improve quality care, and shift care to lower cost settings. ### Technology Innovation Foster use of innovative technologies that promote efficient care delivery, data security, and access to digital health tools by rural facilities, providers, and patients. Projects support access to remote care, improve data sharing, and strengthen cybersecurity, and invest in emerging technologies. ### Workforce Development Attract and retain a high-skilled health care workforce by strengthening recruitment and retention of healthcare providers in rural communities. Help rural providers practice at the top of their license and develop a broader set of providers to serve a rural community's needs, such as community health workers, pharmacists, and individuals trained to help patients navigate the healthcare system. ### Contact Information List Content [Rural Health Transformation Program](http://www.dhhs.nh.gov/node/127091 "View the profile page for Rural Health Transformation Program") Email Address: [rhtf@dhhs.nh.gov](mailto:rhtf@dhhs.nh.gov) 1 [Escape Site](https://www.weather.com/) ![Image 14: scroll to top](http://www.dhhs.nh.gov/themes/custom/state_of_nh_core/library/img/scrollToTop.svg) [![Image 15: The logo image for the website](http://www.dhhs.nh.gov/sites/g/files/ehbemt476/files/new-dhhs-logo-115.png)](http://www.dhhs.nh.gov/) TDD Access: Relay NH [1-800-735-2964](tel:+18007352964 "TDD Access Relay NH phone number") Footer - Agency Links --------------------- * [Contact](http://www.dhhs.nh.gov/contact) * [Subscribe to Newsletters](https://public.govdelivery.com/accounts/NHDHHS/subscriber/new "Subscribe for the latest news from public health, foster care, and more.
