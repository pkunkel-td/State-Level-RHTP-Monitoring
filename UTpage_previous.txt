The Utah Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS) is pleased to announce
the successful first-year award of Utah’s Rural Health Transformation Program
(RHTP) from the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS). **Utah’s
first-year award from CMS totals $195,743,566.** [CMS announced on December 29,
2025](https://www.cms.gov/newsroom/press-releases/cms-announces-50-billion-awards-strengthen-rural-health-all-50-states),
that “all 50 states will receive awards under the Rural Health Transformation
Program, a $50 billion initiative established under President Trump’s Working
Families Tax Cuts legislation (Public Law 119-21) to strengthen and modernize
healthcare in rural communities across the country. This unprecedented federal
investment will help states expand access to care in rural communities,
strengthen the rural health workforce, modernize rural facilities and
technology, and support innovative models that bring high-quality, dependable
care closer to home.” The award comes after the successful submission of
Utah's RHTP application. This award represents a vital opportunity to expand
healthcare access, improve generational health, and strengthen the financial
stability of healthcare facilities across Utah’s rural communities. DHHS
is proud of the comprehensive, innovative, and forward thinking initiatives
submitted and inspired by the transformative potential they hold. DHHS would
like to extend its gratitude to the dedicated workgroup leads, workgroup
members, and all partners and community members who participated throughout
this intensive process. Your expertise, time, and commitment were critical
to shaping this plan and application, as well as securing the award. If you

rural healthcare access, infrastructure, and workforce development**. Utah
is expected to receive a minimum of**$100 million annually**from federal

Medicaid spending for rural Utah due to HR 1, it is also a significant
