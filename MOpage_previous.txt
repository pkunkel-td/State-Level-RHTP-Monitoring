About the ProgramA New Era for Rural Health in Missouri:&nbsp;Understanding the Rural Health Transformation ProgramThe Rural Health Transformation Program (RHTP) is a landmark $50 billion federal investment designed to reshape healthcare in rural communities across America.1&nbsp;Established by Public Law 119-21, this five-year program is not a short-term grant but a significant opportunity to build a stronger, more sustainable healthcare system for the future.1&nbsp;In Missouri, the Department of Social Services (DSS), through its MO HealthNet Division, is leading the state's application effort in close collaboration with the Department of Health and Senior Services (DHSS) and the Department of Mental Health (DMH).3What is the intention of the program?For years, rural communities have faced unique healthcare challenges, including hospital closures, shortages of doctors and nurses, and overall poor health outcomes compared to urban areas.1 The RHTP was created to address these long-standing issues head-on.&nbsp;The program represents a fundamental shift in federal policy. Instead of providing temporary funds to patch financial holes, it aims to support states in making systemic, long-term changes.&nbsp;The goal is to move from a healthcare system that is struggling to survive in rural areas to one that is innovative, financially stable, and built for lasting success.1Strategic GoalsThe Five Strategic GoalsThe Centers for Medicare &amp; Medicaid Services (CMS) has outlined five core goals that guide the RHTP. These goals provide a clear roadmap for the types of projects Missouri will pursue to transform its rural healthcare landscape.Improve Rural Health:&nbsp;The goal is about stopping people from getting sick before it happens, as well as ensuring appropriate access to early identification and upstream interventions. It helps with projects that keep us healthy, looking at the main reasons for diseases like diabetes and heart problems, and make it easier to get important services like mental health and care forpregnant women.1Sustainable Access:&nbsp;The goal is to keep rural hospitals and clinics open by encouraging them to work together. This means they will share resources, improve how they operate, and becomefinancially stable. This way, they can continue to be trusted places for healthcare in their communities.1Workforce Development:&nbsp;The goal is to help fix the shortage of healthcare workers in rural Missouri. It supports programs that bring in, train, and keep skilled workers, such as doctors, nurses, community health workers, and technicians.1Innovative Care:&nbsp;The goal is to create a Community Health Hub, which brings hospitals, clinics, and other community leaders together to meet the health needs of their specific community.This will allow hospitals and clinics to get paid to help patients stay healthy in addition to helping treat them when they get sick.1Tech Innovation:&nbsp;The goal is to use new technology to make healthcare better in rural areas. This means using things like video calls for doctor visits, keeping track of patients from far away, and safely sharing information. This will make healthcare easier and faster for people and doctors in rural areas.1
 
 
 



 
 
The Road to TransformationA Timeline for MissouriThe RHTP has a structured timeline with several key dates that have guided Missouri's application process. Understanding this timeline helps stakeholders see how the state has moved from planning to action.DateEventSignificance for MissouriAugust 26, 2025Missouri DSS Opens Public Comment PeriodThis marked the official start of stakeholder engagement, allowing providers, advocates, and the public to provide crucial input to shape the state's application and priorities.4September 30, 2025Missouri DSS Closes Public Comment PeriodThis was the deadline for initial public and stakeholder feedback, which forms the foundation of Missouri's Rural Health Transformation Plan.4September 30, 2025Optional Letter of Intent Due to CMSMissouri submitted this non-binding letter to inform CMS of its intent to apply for the program, helping the federal government plan for the review process.1November 5, 2025Final Application Due to CMSThis is the hard deadline for Missouri to submit its comprehensive plan, detailing how it will use RHTP funds to achieve the program's five strategic goals.1December 31, 2025CMS Announces State AwardsBy this date, Missouri will learn if its application has been approved and receive its initial funding determination for the first year of the program.1Early January 2026First-Year Funds DistributedOnce approved, Missouri will receive its first allocation of funds, allowing the state to begin implementing the transformative projects outlined in its plan.1Toolbox of StrategiesA Toolbox for Change: How Missouri Can Use RHTP FundsThe RHTP provides states with a broad and flexible "toolbox" of approved activities. To be approved, Missouri's plan must include investments in at least three of the eleven categories below.1 These categories directly align with the program's five strategic goals.&nbsp;Prevention and Chronic Disease:&nbsp;Funding programs that use evidence-based methods to prevent and manage chronic conditions.Example: Expanding the use of providers such as Pharmacists, Community Paramedics and Community Health Workers to address chronic diseases at their root cause.&nbsp;&nbsp;Provider Payments:&nbsp;Making payments to healthcare providers for services, particularly as part of new, innovative payment models.&nbsp;Example: A new payment model for providers to help prevent diseases at their root cause in addition to treating those conditions.&nbsp;&nbsp;Consumer Tech Solutions:&nbsp;Promoting technology that patients can use themselves to manage their health.&nbsp;Example: Using the latest technology tools, including Artificial Intelligence, to help predict and manage chronic diseases.&nbsp;Training and Technical Assistance:&nbsp;Helping rural hospitals adopt advanced technologies like remote monitoring, robotics, or artificial intelligence.&nbsp;Example: Provide training to healthcare workers and others on the latest technology such as Artificial Intelligence to make their more efficient.&nbsp;Workforce:&nbsp;Recruiting and retaining healthcare professionals in rural areas, with a requirement that they serve in the community for at least five years.&nbsp;Example: Connecting rural high school students who are interested in health care careers with internships and other healthcare related opportunities.&nbsp;&nbsp;IT Advances:&nbsp;Providing funds for significant upgrades to information technology, including software, hardware, and cybersecurity.&nbsp;Example: Connecting rural healthcare facilities with specialists using telemedicine for complex and urgent medical and behavioral health care.&nbsp;Appropriate Care Availability:&nbsp;Assisting rural communities in determining the right mix of healthcare services they need to be sustainable.&nbsp;Example: Using a combination of technology such as telemedicine and additional workforce members such as community paramedics and pharmacists to connect patients with the right care at the right time at the right place.&nbsp;Behavioral Health:&nbsp;Supporting access to mental health and substance use disorder treatment.&nbsp;Example: Funding the two-year college education for front-line behavioral health workers.&nbsp;Innovative Care:&nbsp;Developing new models of care, including value-based payment arrangements.&nbsp;Example: Establishing local community-based health Hubs across the state in which hospitals, doctors, rural clinics, behavioral health providers and community-based organizations like food pantries and school-based clinics work together to improve the health of their community.&nbsp;Fostering Collaboration:&nbsp;Creating strategic partnerships between rural facilities and other providers to improve quality, financial stability, and access to care.&nbsp;Example: Establishing regional networks run by a collaboration of hospitals, clinics, and behavioral health professionals to coordinate the care most needed in their region.&nbsp;
 
 
 



 
 
How Much Funding is Available?How RHTP Funding Works: The Two Streams of Support for MissouriThe RHTP will distribute a total of $50 billion nationwide over five federal fiscal years (2026-2030), with $10 billion made available each year.11. Baseline Funding (50% of Total)Half of the program's total funds ($25 billion over five years) are designated as Baseline Funding.1 This money is divided equally among all states that have an approved application. This provides a stable, predictable funding stream that Missouri can count on each year to form the foundation of its transformation plan. If all 50 states are approved, this would amount to approximately $100 million per state annually.102. Workload Funding (50% of Total)The other half of the program's funds ($25 billion over five years) is designated as Workload Funding.1 This funding is distributed competitively based on a formula that evaluates two things: a state's level of rural need and the quality of its transformation plan.1 This creates an opportunity for Missouri to earn significant additional funding by clearly demonstrating its rural health challenges and presenting a thoughtful, strategic, and high-impact plan for the future.How Much Will Missouri Receive?If Missouri's application is approved, the state will receive a portion of these funds through a two-part model designed to provide both a stable foundation and an incentive for high performance. Estimates suggest Missouri could receive between $200 million and $250 million annually through this program.31. Baseline FundingBaseline Funding is distributed over 5 years.1 This ensures a stable annual funding stream, allowing Missouri to support its transformation plan.&nbsp;2. Workload FundingMissouri can secure significant additional funding by effectively showcasing its rural health challenges and presenting a strategic, impactful future plan.Funding TimelineFunding TimelineFunding is awarded in five annual budget periods. A key feature of the program is its flexibility; for each budget period, Missouri will have until the end of the following federal fiscal year (September 30) to spend the awarded funds.1 For example, funds awarded for the first budget period in early 2026 can be spent until September 30, 2027. This will require careful planning for complex, multi-year projects.For each budget period, recipients will have until the end of the following fiscal year (September 30) to spend awarded funding.Recap: Budget Period will start on December 31, 2025. The Federal Fiscal Year begins October 1, but the subsequent Budget Period funding for RHTP will be distributed in November of each fiscal year.&nbsp;
 
 
 



 
 
Key LimitationsProhibited UsesRHTP funds cannot be used for the following:New Construction: Building entirely new facilities is not allowed. However, funds can be used for renovations, alterations, or equipment upgrades in existing buildings.1&nbsp;Supplanting Funds: The money is intended for new or expanded activities. It cannot be used to replace or substitute existing state, local, or private funding for a project that is already underway or budgeted.1&nbsp;Duplicating Billable Services: Funds cannot be used to pay for clinical services that are already reimbursable through programs like Medicaid, Medicare, or private insurance. The goal is to transform care delivery, not just pay for more of the same services.1&nbsp;Lobbying: Federal funds cannot be used for activities designed to influence the passage of legislation or other government actions.1&nbsp;Program-Specific Funding CapsCMS has also set limits on how much of a state's annual award can be spent on certain categories. These caps ensure a balanced investment across different aspects of healthcare transformation.Spending CategoryMaximum AllowedAdministrative Costs (State-level program management, oversight)10% of the state's total annual award1Capital Expenditures (Renovations, equipment upgrades)20% of the state's total annual award1Provider Payments (For direct healthcare services not otherwise billable)15% of the state's total annual award1Replacing an Existing Certified EHR System5% of the state's total annual award1"Rural Tech Catalyst Fund" Initiatives (Funding for health tech startups)The lesser of 10% of the annual award or $20 million1Calculating Missouri's AwardThe Federal Scoring FormulaThe amount of competitive "Workload Funding" Missouri receives each year is determined by a formula that combines two distinct scores. Understanding this formula is key to maximizing the state's award.Score 1: The Rural Facility and Population Score (The "Need" Score)This score is a snapshot of Missouri's existing rural healthcare needs and challenges. It is calculated by CMS only once at the beginning of the program and will not change over the five years1. It is based on several data-driven factors, including:The total number of people living in rural areas of the state.1The number and proportion of rural health facilities, such as Critical Access Hospitals and Rural Health Clinics.1The level of uncompensated care provided by hospitals in the state.1The percentage of the state's total population that lives in rural areas.1The state's total land area and the presence of very remote "frontier" areas.1The percentage of hospitals that receive Medicaid Disproportionate Share Hospital (DSH) payments.1Score 2: The Technical Score (The "Plan and Performance" Score)This score measures the quality, strategic vision, and ultimately the performance of Missouri's transformation plan. This score is recalculated by CMS every year based on the state's progress.1 This annual rescoring is the program's core accountability engine. It turns the RHTP from a simple grant into a dynamic, performance-based partnership.&nbsp;A typical grant provides funding based on an initial application, with reporting focused mainly on compliance. The RHTP, however, ties future funding directly to present performance. If Missouri successfully implements its planned initiatives and meets its policy commitments, its Technical Score—and its Workload Funding—can increase in subsequent years. Conversely, a failure to make progress or follow through on commitments can lead to a lower score and reduced funding.
