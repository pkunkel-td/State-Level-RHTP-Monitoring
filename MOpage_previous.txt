[About the Program](https://mydss.mo.gov/mhd/rural-health#) A New Era for
Rural Health in Missouri: Understanding the Rural Health Transformation Program
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The Rural Health Transformation Program (RHTP) is a landmark $50 billion
federal investment designed to reshape healthcare in rural communities across
America.1 Established by Public Law 119-21, this five-year program is not
a short-term grant but a significant opportunity to build a stronger, more
sustainable healthcare system for the future.1 In Missouri, the Department
of Social Services (DSS), through its MO HealthNet Division, is leading the
state's application effort in close collaboration with the Department of Health
and Senior Services (DHSS) and the Department of Mental Health (DMH).3 What
is the intention of the program? ------------------------------------- For
years, rural communities have faced unique healthcare challenges, including
hospital closures, shortages of doctors and nurses, and overall poor health
outcomes compared to urban areas.1 The RHTP was created to address these
long-standing issues head-on. The program represents a fundamental shift
in federal policy. Instead of providing temporary funds to patch financial
holes, it aims to support states in making systemic, long-term changes. The
goal is to move from a healthcare system that is struggling to survive in
rural areas to one that is innovative, financially stable, and built for
lasting success.1 [Strategic Goals](https://mydss.mo.gov/mhd/rural-health#)
The Five Strategic Goals ------------------------ The Centers for Medicare
& Medicaid Services (CMS) has outlined five core goals that guide the
RHTP. These goals provide a clear roadmap for the types of projects Missouri
will pursue to transform its rural healthcare landscape. ### **Improve
Rural Health:** The goal is about stopping people from getting sick before
it happens, as well as ensuring appropriate access to early identification
and upstream interventions. It helps with projects that keep us healthy,
looking at the main reasons for diseases like diabetes and heart problems,
and make it easier to get important services like mental health and care
for pregnant women.1 ### **Sustainable Access:** The goal is to keep rural
hospitals and clinics open by encouraging them to work together. This means
they will share resources, improve how they operate, and become financially
stable. This way, they can continue to be trusted places for healthcare in
their communities.1 ### **Workforce Development:** The goal is to help fix
the shortage of healthcare workers in rural Missouri. It supports programs
that bring in, train, and keep skilled workers, such as doctors, nurses,
community health workers, and technicians.1 ### **Innovative Care:** The goal
is to create a Community Health Hub, which brings hospitals, clinics, and
other community leaders together to meet the health needs of their specific
community. This will allow hospitals and clinics to get paid to help patients
stay healthy in addition to helping treat them when they get sick.1 ### **Tech
Innovation:** The goal is to use new technology to make healthcare better
in rural areas. This means using things like video calls for doctor visits,
keeping track of patients from far away, and safely sharing information. This
will make healthcare easier and faster for people and doctors in rural
areas.1 [The Road to Transformation](https://mydss.mo.gov/mhd/rural-health#)
A Timeline for Missouri ----------------------- The RHTP has a structured
timeline with several key dates that have guided Missouri's application
process. Understanding this timeline helps stakeholders see how the state has
moved from planning to action. | Date | Event | Significance for Missouri |
| --- | --- | --- | | August 26, 2025 | Missouri DSS Opens Public Comment
Period | This marked the official start of stakeholder engagement, allowing
providers, advocates, and the public to provide crucial input to shape the
state's application and priorities.4 | | September 30, 2025 | Missouri DSS
Closes Public Comment Period | This was the deadline for initial public and
stakeholder feedback, which forms the foundation of Missouri's Rural Health
Transformation Plan.4 | | September 30, 2025 | Optional Letter of Intent
Due to CMS | Missouri submitted this non-binding letter to inform CMS of
its intent to apply for the program, helping the federal government plan for
the review process.1 | | November 5, 2025 | Final Application Due to CMS |
This is the hard deadline for Missouri to submit its comprehensive plan,
detailing how it will use RHTP funds to achieve the program's five strategic
goals.1 | | December 31, 2025 | CMS Announces State Awards | By this date,
Missouri will learn if its application has been approved and receive
its initial funding determination for the first year of the program.1
| | Early January 2026 | First-Year Funds Distributed | Once approved,
Missouri will receive its first allocation of funds, allowing the state to
begin implementing the transformative projects outlined in its plan.1 |
[Toolbox of Strategies](https://mydss.mo.gov/mhd/rural-health#)
A Toolbox for Change: How Missouri Can Use RHTP Funds
----------------------------------------------------- The RHTP provides states
with a broad and flexible "toolbox" of approved activities. To be approved,
Missouri's plan must include investments in at least three of the eleven
categories below.1 These categories directly align with the program's five
strategic goals. ### **Prevention and Chronic Disease:** Funding programs that
use evidence-based methods to prevent and manage chronic conditions. _Example:
Expanding the use of providers such as Pharmacists, Community Paramedics and
Community Health Workers to address chronic diseases at their root cause._ ###
**Provider Payments:** Making payments to healthcare providers for services,
particularly as part of new, innovative payment models. _Example: A new payment
model for providers to help prevent diseases at their root cause in addition
to treating those conditions._ ### **Consumer Tech Solutions:** Promoting
technology that patients can use themselves to manage their health. _Example:
Using the latest technology tools, including Artificial Intelligence, to
help predict and manage chronic diseases._ ### **Training and Technical
Assistance:** Helping rural hospitals adopt advanced technologies like
remote monitoring, robotics, or artificial intelligence. _Example: Provide
training to healthcare workers and others on the latest technology such as
Artificial Intelligence to make their more efficient._ ### **Workforce:**
Recruiting and retaining healthcare professionals in rural areas, with a
requirement that they serve in the community for at least five years. _Example:
Connecting rural high school students who are interested in health care
careers with internships and other healthcare related opportunities._ ###
**IT Advances:** Providing funds for significant upgrades to information
technology, including software, hardware, and cybersecurity. _Example:
Connecting rural healthcare facilities with specialists using telemedicine
for complex and urgent medical and behavioral health care._ ### **Appropriate
Care Availability:** Assisting rural communities in determining the right
mix of healthcare services they need to be sustainable. _Example: Using
a combination of technology such as telemedicine and additional workforce
members such as community paramedics and pharmacists to connect patients
with the right care at the right time at the right place._ ### **Behavioral
Health:** Supporting access to mental health and substance use disorder
treatment. _Example: Funding the two-year college education for front-line
behavioral health workers._ ### **Innovative Care:** Developing new models of
care, including value-based payment arrangements. _Example: Establishing local
community-based health Hubs across the state in which hospitals, doctors, rural
clinics, behavioral health providers and community-based organizations like
food pantries and school-based clinics work together to improve the health
of their community._ ### **Fostering Collaboration:** Creating strategic
partnerships between rural facilities and other providers to improve quality,
financial stability, and access to care. _Example: Establishing regional
networks run by a collaboration of hospitals, clinics, and behavioral
health professionals to coordinate the care most needed in their region._
[How Much Funding is Available?](https://mydss.mo.gov/mhd/rural-health#)
How RHTP Funding Works: The Two Streams of Support for Missouri
--------------------------------------------------------------- The RHTP will
distribute a total of $50 billion nationwide over five federal fiscal years
(2026-2030), with $10 billion made available each year.1 #### 1. Baseline
Funding (50% of Total) Half of the program's total funds ($25 billion over
five years) are designated as Baseline Funding.1 This money is divided equally
among all states that have an approved application. This provides a stable,
predictable funding stream that Missouri can count on each year to form
the foundation of its transformation plan. If all 50 states are approved,
this would amount to approximately $100 million per state annually.10 ####
2. Workload Funding (50% of Total) The other half of the program's funds ($25
billion over five years) is designated as Workload Funding.1 This funding
is distributed competitively based on a formula that evaluates two things:
a state's level of rural need and the quality of its transformation plan.1
This creates an opportunity for Missouri to earn significant additional
funding by clearly demonstrating its rural health challenges and presenting
a thoughtful, strategic, and high-impact plan for the future. How Much Will
Missouri Receive? ------------------------------- If Missouri's application is
approved, the state will receive a portion of these funds through a two-part
model designed to provide both a stable foundation and an incentive for high
performance. Estimates suggest Missouri could receive between $200 million and
$250 million annually through this program.3 #### 1. Baseline Funding Baseline
Funding is distributed over 5 years.1 This ensures a stable annual funding
stream, allowing Missouri to support its transformation plan. #### 2. Workload
Funding Missouri can secure significant additional funding by effectively
showcasing its rural health challenges and presenting a strategic, impactful
future plan. [Funding Timeline](https://mydss.mo.gov/mhd/rural-health#)
Funding Timeline ---------------- Funding is awarded in five annual budget
periods. A key feature of the program is its flexibility; for each budget
period, Missouri will have until the end of the following federal fiscal year
(September 30) to spend the awarded funds.1 For example, funds awarded for the
first budget period in early 2026 can be spent until September 30, 2027. This
will require careful planning for complex, multi-year projects. For each
budget period, recipients will have until the end of the following fiscal
year (September 30) to spend awarded funding. * Recap: Budget Period will
start on December 31, 2025. The Federal Fiscal Year begins October 1, but the
subsequent Budget Period funding for RHTP will be distributed in November of
each fiscal year. [Key Limitations](https://mydss.mo.gov/mhd/rural-health#)
Prohibited Uses --------------- RHTP funds cannot be used for the following:
* New Construction: Building entirely new facilities is not allowed. However,
funds can be used for renovations, alterations, or equipment upgrades in
existing buildings.1 * Supplanting Funds: The money is intended for new or
expanded activities. It cannot be used to replace or substitute existing
state, local, or private funding for a project that is already underway
or budgeted.1 * Duplicating Billable Services: Funds cannot be used to pay
for clinical services that are already reimbursable through programs like
Medicaid, Medicare, or private insurance. The goal is to transform care
delivery, not just pay for more of the same services.1 * Lobbying: Federal
funds cannot be used for activities designed to influence the passage of
legislation or other government actions.1 Program-Specific Funding Caps
----------------------------- CMS has also set limits on how much of a
state's annual award can be spent on certain categories. These caps ensure a
balanced investment across different aspects of healthcare transformation. |
**Spending Category** | **Maximum Allowed** | | --- | --- | | Administrative
Costs (State-level program management, oversight) | 10% of the state's total
annual award 1 | | Capital Expenditures (Renovations, equipment upgrades)
| 20% of the state's total annual award 1 | | Provider Payments (For direct
healthcare services not otherwise billable) | 15% of the state's total annual
award 1 | | Replacing an Existing Certified EHR System | 5% of the state's
total annual award 1 | | "Rural Tech Catalyst Fund" Initiatives (Funding for
health tech startups) | The lesser of 10% of the annual award or $20 million
1 | [Calculating Missouri's Award](https://mydss.mo.gov/mhd/rural-health#) The
Federal Scoring Formula --------------------------- The amount of competitive
"Workload Funding" Missouri receives each year is determined by a formula that
combines two distinct scores. Understanding this formula is key to maximizing
the state's award. ### Score 1: The Rural Facility and Population Score (The
"Need" Score) This score is a snapshot of Missouri's existing rural healthcare
needs and challenges. It is calculated by CMS only once at the beginning
of the program and will not change over the five years 1. It is based on
several data-driven factors, including: * The total number of people living
in rural areas of the state.1 * The number and proportion of rural health
facilities, such as Critical Access Hospitals and Rural Health Clinics.1
* The level of uncompensated care provided by hospitals in the state.1 *
The percentage of the state's total population that lives in rural areas.1
* The state's total land area and the presence of very remote "frontier"
areas.1 * The percentage of hospitals that receive Medicaid Disproportionate
Share Hospital (DSH) payments.1 ### Score 2: The Technical Score (The "Plan
and Performance" Score) This score measures the quality, strategic vision,
and ultimately the performance of Missouri's transformation plan. This score
is recalculated by CMS every year based on the state's progress.1 This annual
rescoring is the program's core accountability engine. It turns the RHTP from
a simple grant into a dynamic, performance-based partnership. A typical grant
provides funding based on an initial application, with reporting focused
mainly on compliance. The RHTP, however, ties future funding directly
to present performance. If Missouri successfully implements its planned
initiatives and meets its policy commitments, its Technical Score—and its
Workload Funding—can increase in subsequent years. Conversely, a failure
to make progress or follow through on commitments can lead to a lower score
and reduced funding. This structure creates a powerful incentive for the
state and its partners to not only write a strong plan but to execute it
effectively, requiring robust project management and transparent reporting from
day one. [Vision & Core Objectives](https://mydss.mo.gov/mhd/rural-health#)
