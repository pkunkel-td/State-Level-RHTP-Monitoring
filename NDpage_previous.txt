Investment & Timeline: $199 million for 2026** Medium **Why this matters**
-------------------- North Dakota’s rural health system is under growing
strain. Workforce shortages, financially fragile facilities, widening outcome
gaps for tribal and frontier communities and fragmented technology threaten
access to care close to home. Plus, people in rural areas often experience
higher rates of chronic diseases. The Rural Health Transformation Program
(RHTP) is North Dakota’s comprehensive, statewide roadmap to stabilize
today’s system, build a more sustainable, modern rural health future and
prevent diabetes, heart disease and stroke and other chronic diseases. Through
four key initiatives, the program focuses on long-term solutions to help make
North Dakota the healthiest state in the nation. ![Image 6: graphic stating

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Overview -------- The One Big Beautiful Bill Act (Section 71401) creates
a new Rural Health Transformation grants program administered by the
Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS), allocating $50 billion
nationwide from federal fiscal years 2026 through 2030 — $10 billion
annually. Funds will flow through states, which must submit a Rural Health
Transformation Plan to CMS by Dec. 31, 2025, to access and manage these
resources. North Dakota is expected to receive approximately $100 million
per year, totaling $500 million over five years, to improve rural health care
access, quality, and sustainability. What is the Rural Health Transformation
Plan? --------------------------------------------- States must submit a
one-time application to CMS, including a plan that outlines how the state
will: * Improve access to hospitals, providers, and health care services for
rural residents * Enhance health outcomes for rural communities * Use emerging
technologies focused on prevention and chronic disease management * Strengthen
partnerships between rural hospitals and providers to improve quality and
financial stability * Support recruitment and training of rural health care
clinicians * Prioritize data-driven solutions and technology to deliver
high-quality care close to home * Address financial solvency and operating
models of rural hospitals * Identify causes driving hospital closures,
conversions, or service reductions Eligible Activities -------------------
States must fund at least three or more designated activities. * Evidence-based
prevention and chronic disease management interventions * Payments to providers
for specified services * Consumer-facing technology solutions for chronic
disease management * Training on advanced tech such as remote monitoring,
AI, and robotics * Recruiting and retaining rural clinical workforce with
service commitments * IT upgrades improving efficiency, cybersecurity,
and outcomes * Helping communities optimize health care delivery systems *
Expanding opioid use disorder, substance use, and mental health services *
Innovative care models including value-based care and alternative payments *
Other CMS-approved activities to ensure sustainable rural health care North
Dakota’s Outreach and Engagement --------------------------------------
HHS is engaging with stakeholders to help shape North Dakota’s Rural
Health Transformation Program. A month-long public survey was launched
on Aug. 13, followed by three listening sessions scheduled in October to
share survey results and gather more input. The state’s application
must be submitted by Nov. 5, 2025, to the Centers for Medicare and
Medicaid Services (CMS) with awards announced by Dec. 31, 2025. States will
partner with CMS to ensure strong oversight and lasting impact. [North Dakota's
