"Rural Health Transformation Program") The [Rural Health Transformation
Program](https://www.finance.senate.gov/imo/media/doc/rural_health_transformation_program_fact_sheet.pdf)
is part of H.R. 1, known as the One Big Beautiful Bill Act passed by Congress
and signed into law July 4, 2025. The $50 billion grant program runs from
Fiscal Year (FY) 2026 through FY 2030, with $10 billion allocated per year
across 50 states. The goal is to increase access to rural health providers
while improving outcomes for individuals living in rural communities. To
help inform Michigan’s strategy for prioritizing the funding from the RHT
Program, MDHHS engaged with rural health providers, community partners,
Medicaid beneficiaries and rural community residents. The department
sought to better understand how this one-time grant could help increase
and improve sustainability for rural providers, and how rural providers
can continue to thrive, expand, and serve their communities, especially
with other predicted federal funding cuts being implemented. **MDHHS
has integrated feedback to inform the following proposed* structure:**
_*We are awaiting review and approval from CMS. Funding from CMS
isn’t guaranteed. Pre-planning efforts are underway in anticipation

Learn More about the RHT Program -------------------------------- * RHT
Strategic Goals The RHT Program seeks to further the following Strategic
Goals: 1. **Make rural America Healthy Again:** Support rural health
innovations and new access points to promote preventative health and address
root causes of diseases. Projects will use evidence-based, outcomes-driven
interventions to improve disease prevention, chronic disease management,
behavioral health, and prenatal care. 2. **Sustainable access:** Help rural
providers become long-term access points for care by improving efficiency and
sustainability. With RHT Program support, rural facilities work together—or
with high-quality regional systems—to share or coordinate operations,
technology, primary and specialty care, and emergency services. 3. **Workforce
development:** Attract and retain a high-skilled health care workforce by
strengthening recruitment and retention of healthcare providers in rural
communities. Help rural providers practice at the top of their license and
develop a broader set of providers to serve a rural community’s needs,
such as community health workers, pharmacists, and individuals trained to
help patients navigate the healthcare system. 4. **Innovative care:** Spark
the growth of innovative care models to improve health outcomes, coordinate
care, and promote flexible care arrangements. Develop and implement payment
mechanisms incentivizing providers or Accountable Care Organizations (ACOs)
to reduce health care costs, improve quality of care, and shift care to lower
cost settings. 5. **Tech innovation:** Foster use of innovative technologies
that promote efficient care delivery, data security, and access to digital
health tools by rural facilities, providers, and patients. Projects support
access to remote care, improve data sharing, strengthen cybersecurity,
and invest in emerging technologies. * Cross-Departmental Coordination Team
During the pre-implementation planning period (November-December 2025), a
Cross-Departmental Coordination Team will be established to: * Offer expert
input based on each division’s area of specialization to inform program
design and sustainability planning. Provide cross-departmental guidance to
maximize impact, identify opportunities for shared investments, and prevent
duplication of funding or programmatic efforts. * Provide guidance on language
to include in Grant Funding Opportunity (GFO) and may participate on Joint
Evaluation Committee to review and select grantees. * Review progress reports,
performance data, and partner feedback to identify challenges and recommend
course corrections to leadership. * Act as liaisons between their divisions and
the RHT Program Office to support coordinated messaging, consistent reporting,
and timely decision-making. * RHT Advisory Council An RHT Advisory Council
will be established to: * Support the development and implementation of an
engagement strategy to strengthen collaboration with rural health partners,
community leaders, and residents throughout the program lifecycle. * Provide
insight and feedback to improve partner participation during implementation
and evaluation, ensuring that community and stakeholder perspectives inform
ongoing refinement of initiatives. * Offer actionable recommendations to MDHHS
to inform strategic direction and policy decisions across the Rural Health
Transformation initiatives. * Serve as a bridge between state leadership,
local stakeholders, and rural communities to ensure transparent communication
and shared understanding of program priorities and outcomes. To stay updated on
the process of seating the RHT Advisory Council, including when the nomination
period will open, please sign up for email updates via the RHT listserv. *
Grant Funding Opportunity (GFO) A GFO will soon be released to support RHT
efforts. Details about eligibility, timelines, and application requirements
will be shared once the GFO is published. To receive updates as soon as the
RHT GFO is released, please sign up for the listserv. Subscribers will be
the first to know when the funding announcement, application materials,
and technical assistance resources become available. **Michigan's
