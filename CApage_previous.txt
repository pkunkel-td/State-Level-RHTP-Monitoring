California State Office of Rural Health ======================================= ![Image 4: Two young boys leaning on the fence in a rural area.](https://hcai.ca.gov/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Kids-on-the-fence-edited.png) **Rural Health Transformation Program (RHTP)**[#](https://hcai.ca.gov/workforce/health-workforce/california-state-office-of-rural-health/#rural-health-transformation-program-rhtp) ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- The **Rural Health Transformation Program (RHTP)** is a federal initiative designed to strengthen health care in rural communities where access, workforce shortages, and infrastructure gaps create unique challenges. HCAI has submitted California’s RHTP application on behalf of the state. A decision regarding approved projects and award amounts is anticipated to be announced by December 31, 2025. This webpage will be updated as implementation details for the program in California become available. **Please note**: the RHTP application narratives are currently under review by Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS), the information in the documents linked below may be subject to change pending final CMS award decisions. See the RHTP application resources below: * [RHTP Program Overview](https://hcai.ca.gov/document/rural-health-transformation-program-overview/) * [RHTP Project Narrative](https://hcai.ca.gov/document/rhtp-project-narrative/) * [RHTP Budget Narrative](https://hcai.ca.gov/document/rhtp-budget-narrative/) * [RHTP Project Abstract](https://hcai.ca.gov/document/rhtp-project-abstract/) Established through [**H.R.1**](https://cahcai.sharepoint.com/sites/HWDD/ProjectsPolicy/Shared%20Documents/Forms/AllItems.aspx?id=%2Fsites%2FHWDD%2FProjectsPolicy%2FShared%20Documents%2FFederal%20Policy%20Unit%2FSORH%2FRural%20Health%20Transformation%20Program%2FOBBA%20Bill%20%2D%20Chapter%204%20RHTP%20Provisions%2Epdf&parent=%2Fsites%2FHWDD%2FProjectsPolicy%2FShared%20Documents%2FFederal%20Policy%20Unit%2FSORH%2FRural%20Health%20Transformation%20Program) and signed into law in July 2025, the program created the Rural Health Transformation Fund — a $50 billion investment over five years, available to all 50 states that apply. This funding is not intended to supplement Medicare or Medicaid, but rather to give states the resources to reimagine how rural health care is delivered and financed. In California, the Department of Healthcare Access and Information’s State Office of Rural Health (CalSORH) is leading the effort. Guided by input from rural health leaders and feedback gathered through broad stakeholder engagement, CalSORH will use this plan to inform long-term investments, partnerships, and policy initiatives aimed at creating sustainable, resilient rural health systems. **We want your input!** Your voice is critical in shaping the future of rural health care.
