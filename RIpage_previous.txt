Rural Health Transformation Program
=================================== On ,[H.R. 1 was signed into
law](https://www.cms.gov/files/document/chapter-4-protecting-rural-health-hospitals-providers.pdf),
establishing the federal $50 billion[Rural Health Transformation
Program](https://www.cms.gov/priorities/rural-health-transformation-rht-program/rural-health-transformation-rht-program)
(RHTP) to improve rural healthcare across all fifty states.The program
provides federal funding from federal fiscal years 2026-2030 to
improve access, quality, and sustainability of rural healthcare. The
program is administered at the federal level by the Centers for
Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS). Mission ------- To improve
access, quality, and sustainability of rural healthcare. What We Do
---------- Collaborate with the [Executive Office of Health and Human
Services](https://eohhs.ri.gov/initiatives/rural-health-transformation-grant)
(EOHHS), other State agencies, hospitals, healthcare professionals, and
community partners to implement the federal Rural Health Transformation
Program award in Rhode Island, transform healthcare delivery in the state’s
18 rural towns, and provide critical support to local providers. About the
Program ----------------- In December 2025, Rhode Island’s application
for the Rural Health Transformation Program (RHTP) was approved by
the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS). The State has been
awarded $156,169,931 for Year 1, a meaningful investment in the future
of healthcare delivery, particularly in our rural communities. To learn
more about the program and next steps for implementation, see the [EOHHS
website](https://eohhs.ri.gov/initiatives/rural-health-transformation-grant).
**About Rural Health in Rhode Island** Rhode Island’s rural
communities face unique challenges, including limited access to care,
workforce shortages, transportation barriers, and persistent health
disparities. While Rhode Island is the smallest state, rural health
disparities affect thousands of residents. **Federally Designated Rural
Areas:** New Shoreham (Block Island); Westerly **Rhode Island-Specific
Rural Definition:** * Developed by the[Office of Primary Care and Rural
Health](https://health.ri.gov/healthcare/primary-care-and-rural-health-office)
and approved by the[Federal Office of Rural Health
Policy](https://www.hrsa.gov/about/organization/bureaus/forhp?_cldee=KnNOgW4YuKHfIxqyBwjebqvJo2uvA01zHwGObzEV66YbNO3HS7NUGs60wycvYByQ&esid=1a7fb36e-df5c-f011-bec1-00224821b7bb&recipientid=contact-991ccc1fc4cbec11a7b5000d3a13c956-7f84a713558042cfac6bf6bde01eb5c0)

**Goals** Rhode Island’s vision for Rural Health Transformation
is to build a connected, community-driven system that ensures
every rural resident has timely, coordinated, high-quality care
close to home. To achieve this vision, the state centered [its
proposal](https://eohhs.ri.gov/initiatives/rural-health-transformation-grant)
around the following goals and strategies: **Goal 1: Make Rural America
Healthy Again – Improve the Health of Rural Residents** Advance coordinated,
community-based population health strategies to address chronic disease,
behavioral health, substance use, maternal and child health, oral health,
and other root causes to improve outcomes for rural Rhode Islanders. **Goal 2:
Sustainable Access – Expand Access to Comprehensive, Quality, Low-Cost Care**
Increase local access points for urgent, primary, behavioral, and specialty
care services—beyond clinics and hospitals—reaching rural residents where
they live, work, and gather, such as schools, libraries, community centers,
and even their homes. **Goal 3: Workforce Development – Strengthen the
Rural Health Care Workforce** Build and expand workforce efforts through
rural training opportunities, providing incentives for providers to practice
in rural communities, enhancing partnerships with educational institutions
to build training capacity, and supporting individuals at all stages
of their health care careers. **Goal 4: Innovative Care – Accelerate
Value-Based and Affordable Care Models** Advance comprehensive primary
care transformation and support hospitals and practices in transitioning
to alternative payment models through incentives, technical assistance,
and clinical and operational infrastructure. **Goal 5: Tech Innovation –
Integrate Technology into Rural Practice** Strengthen health information
technology through cost-effective, secure, and interoperable systems to expand
remote care, improve data sharing and cybersecurity, and explore responsible
use of artificial intelligence (AI). **Application Documents** * [Project
