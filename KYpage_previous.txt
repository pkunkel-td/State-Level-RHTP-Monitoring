Health Transformation​
-------------------------------------------------------- The Commonwealth
of Kentucky has been awarded funding through the Centers for Medicare &
Medicaid Services (CMS) Rural Health Transformation Fund (RHTF). This
investment will empower Kentucky to launch and implement its Rural Health
Transformation Plan (RHTP) — a community-driven strategy to expand access
and improve health outcomes for rural residents across the Commonwealth. ###
**Our Plan** Kentucky’s RHTP launches five interrelated initiatives
designed to build rural health infrastructure and provide sustainable,
long-term improvements. This plan directly supports Kentucky’s
rural counties while advancing statewide impact through innovation,
technology-enabled care and strengthened workforce recruitment pipelines
for both clinical and non-clinical staff. This strategy will help build
a resilient, integrated and technology-forward health system across the
Commonwealth.​ 1. **Rural Community Hubs for Chronic Care Innovation:**
Establishes local “hub-and-spoke” collaboratives focused on obesity and
diabetes prevention and management. These hubs will integrate nutrition,
physical activity programs and digital self-management tools. 2. **PoWERing
Maternal and Infant Health:**Expands timely prenatal and postpartum care by
deploying telehealth-enabled maternal care teams who will serve maternity-care
deserts and high-risk regions, to help mothers and infants receive seamless,
high-quality support. 3. **Rapid Response to Recovery (EmPATH Model):**Deploys
technology-enabled crisis stabilization and mobile behavioral health response
teams to connect individuals with community-based treatment and recovery
supports.​ 4. **Rooted in Health: Rural Dental Access:** Increases access
to preventive oral health services through expanded dental hygiene training
programs, externships and portable/tele-dental clinics. 5. ​**Crisis
to Care: Integrated Emergency Medical Services (EMS) Response and
Coordination:**Enhances pre-hospital capacity and trauma coordination through
treat-in-place protocols, improved data connectivity and workforce training
for rural EMS providers. ### About the Program ​The RHTF grant spans five
budget periods aligned with federal fiscal years (FY2026–FY2030). Funding is
disbursed annually by CMS based on achievement of performance metrics. View the
Notice of Funding Opportunity from CMS.​ * The Commonwealth of Kentucky is
the 10th most rural state in the country, with 1.87 million individuals(41.6%)
of its total state population residing in a rural area as defined by the Health
Resources and Services Administration (HRSA). Kentucky’s RHTP strategies
target five critical rural health priority areas that disproportionately
affect rural Kentuckians: * **Chronic disease:** Seventeen percent of
Kentuckians live with multiple chronic conditions, compared with 11%
nationally. * **Maternal health:**One in six women of childbearing age
lives in a maternity care desert, over four times the national average. *
**Behavioral health:** Crisis response often falls to first responders and
emergency departments, since many rural health areas lack sufficient mental
health professionals. * **Oral health:** Appalachian counties have among the
lowest dental visit rates and the highest rates of complete tooth loss among
seniors. * **Emergency and trauma systems:** Nearly half of all paramedics are
concentrated in the state’s five largest counties, leaving many rural areas
without timely response capacity.​ * ​Learn more about CMS and its five

* CMS released [Notice of Funding
Opportunity​](https://www.grants.gov/search-results-detail/360442): September
15, 2025. * Application due: November 5, 2025. * Awards announced: December 31,
2025. * Program begins: Quarter 1 of 2026. * ​Rural Health Transformation
will be guided by an interdisciplinary A 3 Team (Aspire → Activate →
Attain) within the Kentucky Department for Public Health, supported by the
Cabinet for Health and Family Services agencies and external partners. The A 3
Team will coordinate planning, financial oversight, and performance management
to ensure alignment across CHFS and community providers. This approach
emphasizes accountability, rapid-cycle learning, and local flexibility,
allowing communities to adapt models to their specific needs while advancing
statewide goals. * ​Public input was critical to shaping Kentucky’s
RHTP application. Thank you to those who responded to our statewide rural
health Request for Information (RFI). We look forward to continued stakeholder
engagement throughout the lifecycle of this program, which aims to center rural
voices and community-based solutions. ​​​​​​ R esources ​​
