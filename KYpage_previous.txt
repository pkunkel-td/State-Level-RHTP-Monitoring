Health Transformation​
-------------------------------------------------------- The
Commonwealth of Kentucky has been awarded funding through the Centers
for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) Rural Health Transformation Fund
(RHTF). This investment will empower Kentucky to launch and implement
its Rural Health Transformation Plan (RHTP) — a community-driven
strategy to expand access and improve health outcomes for rural
residents across the Commonwealth. [Read Governor Beshear’s press
release](https://www.kentucky.gov/Pages/Activity-stream.aspx?n=GovernorBeshear&prId=2666).
**** ### **Our Plan** Kentucky’s RHTP launches five interrelated initiatives
designed to build rural health infrastructure and provide sustainable,
long-term improvements. This plan directly supports Kentucky’s
rural counties while advancing statewide impact through innovation,
technology-enabled care and strengthened workforce recruitment pipelines
for both clinical and non-clinical staff. This strategy will help build
a resilient, integrated and technology-forward health system across the
Commonwealth.​ 1. **Rural Community Hubs for Chronic Care Innovation:**
Establishes local “hub-and-spoke” collaboratives focused on obesity and
diabetes prevention and management. These hubs will integrate nutrition,
physical activity programs and digital self-management tools. 2. **PoWERing
Maternal and Infant Health:**Expands timely prenatal and postpartum care by
deploying telehealth-enabled maternal care teams who will serve maternity-care
deserts and high-risk regions, to help mothers and infants receive seamless,
high-quality support. 3. **Rapid Response to Recovery (EmPATH Model):**Deploys
technology-enabled crisis stabilization and mobile behavioral health response
teams to connect individuals with community-based treatment and recovery
supports.​ 4. **Rooted in Health: Rural Dental Access:** Increases access
to preventive oral health services through expanded dental hygiene training
programs, externships and portable/tele-dental clinics. 5. ​**Crisis
to Care: Integrated Emergency Medical Services (EMS) Response and
Coordination:**Enhances pre-hospital capacity and trauma coordination through
treat-in-place protocols, improved data connectivity and workforce training
for rural EMS providers. ### About the Program ​The RHTF grant spans five
budget periods aligned with federal fiscal years (FY2026–FY2030). Funding
is disbursed annually by CMS based on achievement of performance
metrics. View the Notice of Funding Opportunity from CMS.​ [Rural Health

* The Commonwealth of Kentucky is the 10th most rural state in the country,
with 1.87 million individuals(41.6%) of its total state population residing
in a rural area as defined by the Health Resources and Services Administration
(HRSA). Kentucky’s RHTP strategies target five critical rural health priority
areas that disproportionately affect rural Kentuckians: * **Chronic disease:**
Seventeen percent of Kentuckians live with multiple chronic conditions,
compared with 11% nationally. * **Maternal health:**One in six women of
childbearing age lives in a maternity care desert, over four times the
national average. * **Behavioral health:** Crisis response often falls to
first responders and emergency departments, since many rural health areas
lack sufficient mental health professionals. * **Oral health:** Appalachian
counties have among the lowest dental visit rates and the highest rates of
complete tooth loss among seniors. * **Emergency and trauma systems:** Nearly
half of all paramedics are concentrated in the state’s five largest counties,
leaving many rural areas without timely response capacity.​ [CMS Strategic

* ​Rural Health Transformation will be guided by an interdisciplinary A 3
Team (Aspire → Activate → Attain) within the Kentucky Department for Public
Health, supported by the Cabinet for Health and Family Services agencies
and external partners. The A 3 Team will coordinate planning, financial
oversight, and performance management to ensure alignment across CHFS and
community providers. This approach emphasizes accountability, rapid-cycle
learning, and local flexibility, allowing communities to adapt models
to their specific needs while advancing statewide goals. [Thank You for Your
Support](https://ruralhealthplan.ky.gov/Pages/index.aspx#ctl00_ctl00_m_g_df901d45_9db9_4149_9349_6caca144649d_ctl02_AccordionList_ctrl4_Collapse)
* ​Public input was critical to shaping Kentucky’s RHTP application. Thank
you to those who responded to our statewide rural health Request for
Information (RFI). We look forward to continued stakeholder engagement
throughout the lifecycle of this program, which aims to center
rural voices and community-based solutions. ​​​​​​
