On Dec. 29, 2025, the [Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services
(CMS)](https://www.cms.gov/newsroom/press-releases/cms-announces-50-billion-awards-strengthen-rural-health-all-50-states)
awarded Hawaiʻi $188,892,440 through the Rural Health Transformation
Program. The Rural Health Transformation Program (RHTP) is a $50 billion,
5-year fund created by the One Big Beautiful Bill Act awarded to all 50 states
through a competitive application process. This award represents Hawaiʻi’s
funding for Federal fiscal year 2026 and is the first year of a five-year
program, with additional annual awards expected through 2030, subject to
federal approval and performance. Governor Josh Green worked directly with
national leaders at the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services and CMS to
help shape the Rural Health Transformation Program as a nationwide initiative,
ensuring rural communities in all 50 states — including Hawaiʻi — were
eligible for funding. RHTP funds are designed to invest in new or yet to be
funded areas to provide for lasting improvement in rural health. Notably,
the funds cannot supplant or replace existing funds. * * * **Why This Matters
for Hawaiʻi** -------------------------------- Healthcare in Hawaiʻi is
heavily concentrated on Oʻahu, while 95.1% of the state’s land area is
rural, creating major barriers for residents on neighbor islands and in rural
Oʻahu. Long travel distances, limited specialty care, workforce shortages and
aging infrastructure have left too many communities without timely access to
primary care, behavioral healthcare and emergency services. This investment
allows Hawaiʻi to close that gap — bringing modern healthcare closer to
where people live, work and raise their families. * * * **Hawaiʻi’s Rural
Health Transformation Plan** ----------------------------------------------
The $188.9 million award was based on factors about the State and details in
the Hawai‘i Rural Health Transformation Plan submitted by the State. Despite
being one of the lowest scoring states in terms of data-driven factors
(e.g., total rural population, geographic size), Hawai‘i will receive
among the highest amount in terms of dollars per capita, and among the
very highest in terms of dollar per rural resident due to program proposal
quality. The size of this award was driven by the strength of the Hawai‘i
Rural Health Transformation Plan, drafted by the Governor’s Office in
coordination with the Department of Health, Department of Human Services,
University of Hawai‘i, and local health leaders. The submitted five-year
plan seeks to transform the rural health care delivery system in a sustainable
manner that will improve healthcare access, quality, and outcomes for the
rural population that comprise 40.8% of the state (all neighbor islands
and rural parts of Oahu). The plan is built around six interconnected
initiatives that strengthen access, workforce, infrastructure, technology
and sustainability. * * * **The Six Initiatives** -----------------------
### **1. Rural Health Information Network (RHIN)** A statewide digital
backbone connecting rural hospitals, clinics and health centers through
interoperable electronic health records, secure wireless networks, referral
systems and shared data platforms. ### **2. Pili Ola Telehealth Network**
A statewide telehealth system expanding virtual care by deploying access
points in schools, libraries, workplaces and community centers, supported
by telehealth navigators and remote patient monitoring. ### **3. Rural
Infrastructure for Care Access (RICA)** Expansion of emergency medical
services, mobile healthcare, community paramedicine and behavioral health
capacity, including a real-time statewide emergency and trauma coordination
center. ### **4. HOME RUN – Rural Healthcare Workforce Pipeline** New
rural training sites, residencies, nursing transition-to-practice programs,
high-school healthcare certificates, scholarships and incentives to recruit
and retain healthcare professionals. ### **5. Rural Respite Network** Five
new medical respite centers in Kauaʻi, Maui, Kona, Hilo and Waiʻanae
to reduce preventable hospital stays and support recovery for patients
experiencing homelessness or post-acute medical needs. ### **6. Rural
Value-Based Innovation and AHEAD Readiness Fund** A competitive fund
helping rural providers adopt value-based care and population-health models,
preparing Hawaiʻi for the CMS AHEAD payment system. * * * **See the
Plan** ---------------- On September 15, CMS released the RHTP [Notice
of Funding Opportunity](https://grants.gov/search-results-detail/360442)
(NOFO), unveiling details about application requirements and funding
metrics. In less than two months, the State of Hawaiʻi submitted
its application on November 4, outlining its plan for the funds and
adhering to all requirements established by CMS. CMS required all states
(from Rhode Island to Texas) to make an initial $1 billion request, with
five annual budgets of $200 million. Actual funds would be determined by
competitive scoring metrics outlined in the NOFO. Preliminary estimates
suggested a competitive application from the State of would yield a roughly
$150 million annual award given its lower data-driven factors. The State
secured its first-year award of $188.9 million by scoring among the best
by competitive program design factors. See the application submitted to CMS
[here](https://engage.hawaii.gov/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Compiled-RHT-Application_Redacted29.pdf).
_Note: this plan is not the final cooperative agreement with CMS and will
be subject to change._ The State must modify its budget and programs in
line with a final cooperative agreement established between CMS and the
State of Hawaiʻi. Once received, such funds cannot be used to replace or
offset other federal or state spending, approved uses of funds are narrow in
nature and must follow state procurement laws. * * * **What Happens Next**
--------------------- Hawaiʻi has entered formal discussion with CMS
regarding implementation of the award. The state will finalize an updated
budget based on the $188.9 million FY 2026 award following negotiations with
CMS, then begin releasing funds to lead agencies and partners. An oversight
team will coordinate across state departments, healthcare providers and
community organizations to ensure the plan is delivered on time, on budget
and with measurable improvements in access, quality, workforce stability
and system sustainability. Additional funding is expected in future years
as the five-year program continues. For more information on the award, click
