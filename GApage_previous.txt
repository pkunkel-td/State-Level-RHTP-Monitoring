**Click**[**here**](https://dch.georgia.gov/events/2026-01-15/ahead-model-information-session)**to
attend our Value-Based Care Webinar on Thursday, January 15!**
**Click**[**here**](https://dch.georgia.gov/georgias-application-rht-program)**to
see a copy of Georgia’s application.** **Overview** On July 4, 2025,
Congress passed H.R. 1, commonly referred to as the One Big Beautiful
Bill Act. This bill creates an opportunity for the state of Georgia to
apply for funds under a new Rural Health Transformation Program. States
can apply for $10 billion per year, for five years. $5 billion per year
will be evenly distributed to all states that apply and $5 billion will
be distributed based on a methodology determined by the Secretary of the
U.S. Department of Health and Human Services. From August 11- 29, 2025,
the Department of Community Health accepted public input on ideas that will
potentially shape the grant process. All submissions are being reviewed,
and DCH may reach out to the respondents for further information. Priority
will be given to suggestions that meet the following criteria: * Support for
rural providers with “rural” being defined as a population of 50,000
or less * Short term projects (able to be accomplished within 24 months,
or projects that include discrete components that can be implemented in
24-month increments) * Not anticipated to create ongoing obligations from
the state beyond the end of the defined allocation * Suggestion meets
at least one of the statutorily-required activities DCH received formal
application guidance from CMS on September 15, 2025. **Town Hall Events**
DCH was committed to hearing suggestions from stakeholders throughout the
state and provided four opportunities for interested parties to participate
in town hall meetings in Cordele, Jasper, Vidalia, and virtually. **Public
Comments** Thank you for everyone who submitted comments to DCH in support
of transforming and improving rural health care in Georgia. Please click
[here](https://app.smartsheet.com/b/publish?EQBCT=117906dc99aa46deb3c68bdb817e77b1)
to see the online submissions. **Next Steps** Georgia was
[awarded](https://dch.georgia.gov/announcement/2025-12-31/rural-health-transformation-program-first-year-award)
$218.8 million for the first year of the five-year program. DCH will continue
to keep the public informed on next steps here. For inquiries, email [[email
