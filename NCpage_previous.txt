Rural Health Transformation Program ===================================
On Dec. 29, 2025, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid
Services (CMS) [awarded North Carolina over $213 million in federal
funding](https://www.ncdhhs.gov/news/press-releases/2025/12/29/north-carolina-awarded-213-million-rural-health-transformation-program)
through the Rural Health Transformation Program (RHTP). North Carolina
applied for the funds to improve healthcare for rural North Carolinians
and their communities. NCDHHS will host a virtual town hall on Friday,
Jan. 16, from 2:30-3:30 p.m. to highlight NCRHTP program goals,
next steps and statewide impact. At this time, event registration
has reached capacity. If you have not previously registered or
are unable to join via Zoom, please join us on the [NCDHHS YouTube

Why This Matters ---------------- North Carolina has the second-largest
rural population in the U.S., with nearly 3 million residents living in
rural areas. This plan reflects NCDHHS’s commitment to ensuring that every
North Carolinian, no matter where they live, has access to high-quality
healthcare. The North Carolina Rural Health Transformation Program
(NCRHTP) emerged from extensive engagement with more than 420 stakeholders
across the state, including rural hospitals, community health centers,
local health departments, faith-based organizations, Tribal communities
and community members. A Plan Built With, and For, Rural North Carolina
------------------------------------------------ The plan is designed so that
every North Carolinian can see the benefit of this work —from farmers in
Robeson County to teachers in Madison County, small business owners in Bertie
County, and parents in Dare County. It aims to strengthen the healthcare
infrastructure that supports individuals, families, and communities across
the entire state. The comprehensive initiative focuses on six interconnected
strategies: * **Community-Rooted Care Networks**: Establishing locally governed
"NC ROOTS" Hubs that connect medical, behavioral health, and social services,
making it easier for rural residents to access comprehensive care close to
home * **Prevention and Chronic Disease Management**: Expanding programs
for diabetes and hypertension control, cancer screening, maternal health
services, and nutrition support, including "food as medicine" initiatives *
**Behavioral Health Expansion**: Growing mental health and substance use
disorder services through new clinics, mobile crisis teams, school-based
programs, and integration with primary care * **Workforce Development**:
Training and retaining healthcare professionals through rural residency
programs, incentives and innovative career pathways—creating jobs while
addressing provider shortages * **Financial Sustainability**: Helping rural
practices and hospitals transition to value-based payment models that
reward keeping people healthy, not just treating illness * **Technology
and Innovation**: Deploying cutting-edge artificial intelligence to support
rural providers, expanding broadband access, improving health information
sharing, and ensuring digital literacy for all residents Partnerships Across
Sectors --------------------------- Implementation will be guided by a
statewide steering committee including NCDHHS’ Office of Rural Health
and divisions of Medicaid, Public Health, and Mental Health, working in
partnership with university and community college partners, and numerous
community partners. Next Steps and Timeline ----------------------- NCDHHS
anticipates receiving CMS's funding decision by . If awarded, implementation
would begin in early 2026 with continued community engagement to refine
and expand programs based on local needs. The department is committed
to transparency throughout implementation, with regular public updates,
community forums, and opportunities for ongoing stakeholder input. By the
Numbers -------------- * **Nearly 3 million** rural North Carolinians
served across **85 counties** * **At least $100 million** in federal
investment over five years * **400+** rural health facilities supported *
**Six**integrated initiatives addressing workforce, access, technology,
behavioral health, chronic disease, and payment models * **420+**stakeholders
engaged in application development More on RHTP ------------ RHTP is part of
H.R. 1, a federal reconciliation bill signed into law in July that includes
significant changes to Medicaid. [RHTP provides one-time funding to states
to support rural communities](https://www.ncdhhs.gov/nc-rhtp-overview/open)
in improving health care access, quality and outcomes. The program is a
cooperative agreement designed to help states transform rural health care
delivery systems by investing in innovation, infrastructure, partnerships
and workforce development. It is not a replacement for Medicaid funding,
but rather a strategic opportunity to strengthen rural health systems in the
face of longstanding challenges. The first $25 billion from RHTP will be split
evenly between all 50 states and will equal about $100 million each year for
the next five years for North Carolina. The second $25 billion will be split
at CMS' discretion among all 50 states over the next five years. You can see
