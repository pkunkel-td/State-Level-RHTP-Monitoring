Why This Matters ---------------- North Carolina has the second-largest
rural population in the U.S., with nearly 3 million residents living in
rural areas. This plan reflects NCDHHS’s commitment to ensuring that every
North Carolinian, no matter where they live, has access to high-quality
healthcare. The North Carolina Rural Health Transformation Program
(NCRHTP) emerged from extensive engagement with more than 420 stakeholders
across the state, including rural hospitals, community health centers,
local health departments, faith-based organizations, Tribal communities
and community members. A Plan Built With, and For, Rural North Carolina
------------------------------------------------ The plan is designed so that
every North Carolinian can see the benefit of this work —from farmers in
Robeson County to teachers in Madison County, small business owners in Bertie
County, and parents in Dare County. It aims to strengthen the healthcare
infrastructure that supports individuals, families, and communities across
the entire state. The comprehensive initiative focuses on six interconnected
strategies: * **Community-Rooted Care Networks**: Establishing locally governed
"NC ROOTS" Hubs that connect medical, behavioral health, and social services,
making it easier for rural residents to access comprehensive care close to
home * **Prevention and Chronic Disease Management**: Expanding programs
for diabetes and hypertension control, cancer screening, maternal health
services, and nutrition support, including "food as medicine" initiatives *
**Behavioral Health Expansion**: Growing mental health and substance use
disorder services through new clinics, mobile crisis teams, school-based
programs, and integration with primary care * **Workforce Development**:
Training and retaining healthcare professionals through rural residency
programs, incentives and innovative career pathways—creating jobs while
addressing provider shortages * **Financial Sustainability**: Helping
rural practices and hospitals transition to value-based payment models that
reward keeping people healthy, not just treating illness * **Technology and
Innovation**: Deploying cutting-edge artificial intelligence to support rural
providers, expanding broadband access, improving health information sharing,
and ensuring digital literacy for all residents Partnerships Across Sectors
--------------------------- Implementation will be guided by a statewide
steering committee including NCDHHS’ Office of Rural Health and divisions
of Medicaid, Public Health, and Mental Health, working in partnership
with university and community college partners, and numerous community
partners. Next Steps and Timeline ----------------------- NCDHHS anticipates
receiving CMS's funding decision by . If awarded, implementation would
begin in early 2026 with continued community engagement to refine and expand
programs based on local needs. The department is committed to transparency
throughout implementation, with regular public updates, community forums,
and opportunities for ongoing stakeholder input. By the Numbers --------------
* **Nearly 3 million** rural North Carolinians served across **85 counties**
* **At least $100 million** in federal investment over five years * **400+**
rural health facilities supported * **Six**integrated initiatives addressing
workforce, access, technology, behavioral health, chronic disease, and
payment models * **420+**stakeholders engaged in application development
More on RHTP ------------ RHTP is part of H.R. 1, a federal reconciliation
bill signed into law in July that includes significant changes to
Medicaid. [RHTP provides one-time funding to states to support rural
communities](https://www.ncdhhs.gov/nc-rhtp-overview/open) in improving
health care access, quality and outcomes. The program is a cooperative
agreement designed to help states transform rural health care delivery
systems by investing in innovation, infrastructure, partnerships and
workforce development. It is not a replacement for Medicaid funding,
but rather a strategic opportunity to strengthen rural health systems
in the face of longstanding challenges. The first $25 billion from RHTP
will be split evenly between all 50 states and will equal about $100
million each year for the next five years for North Carolina. The
second $25 billion will be split at CMS' discretion among all 50
states over the next five years. You can see more about the needs of
