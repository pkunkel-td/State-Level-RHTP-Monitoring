### **Summary** On July 3, Congress passed via the FY 2025 budget
reconciliation process H.R.1, the One Big Beautiful Bill Act (OBBBA), and on
July 4, the President signed it into law. Section 71401 of the Bill modifies
Section 2105 of the Social Security Act and establishes a $50 billion grant
program ($10 billion per fiscal year for FY 2026 – 2030) for the Department
of Health and Human Services (HHS) to distribute payments to the 50 states
through the Rural Health Transformation Program. Applications to participate
in the grant program must be approved by the HHS Secretary no later than
. The Office of the Governor, in coordination with the Mississippi Division
of Medicaid (DOM) and the Mississippi State Department of Health (MSDH),
intends to solicit public input through a public survey and a stakeholder
forum to develop a Rural Health Transformation Plan (Plan), and submit
a timely application for the grant funding. The Office of the Governor
will make the final selection for initiatives included in the Plan. The
Rural Health Transformation Fund forum scheduled for Thursday, , will be
by invitation only. Selected presenters will be allotted a time slot to
present their idea(s) for the Mississippi Rural Health Transformation Program
directly to representatives from the Mississippi Office of the Governor,
the Mississippi Division of Medicaid, and the Mississippi State Department
of Health. This is not an open forum; each presenter’s participation will
conclude with their presentation. Full Text of bill: [Text – H.R.1 – 119th
