New York State has submitted its application to the Centers for Medicare
& Medicaid Services (CMS) for the [Rural Health Transformation (RHT)
Program](https://www.cms.gov/priorities/rural-health-transformation-rht-program/overview).
New York's Rural Health Transformation plan includes the following
initiatives: **Rural Community Health Integration:** Establish coordinated
rural health partnerships that facilitate/finance communities to develop
comprehensive care coordination enhancing patient access to a wide range
of providers across the care continuum, effectively addressing health
and social needs. **Strengthening Rural Communities with Technology -
Enhanced Primary Care:** Improve rural patient access and utilization of
high-quality primary care through the Patient- Centered Medical Home model
with the incorporation of Artificial Intelligence. A primary care practice
designated a Patient-Centered Medical Home by the National Committee for
Quality Assurance focuses on team-based care, patient-centered access and
continuity of care, care management support when needed, care coordination,
and quality improvement processes. **Rural Roots:** Building a Sustainable
Rural Healthcare Workforce: Create a self-sustaining cycle of workforce
development and pipeline that addresses both immediate staffing needs
and long-term capacity-building, ensuring New York's rural communities
have continuous access to high-quality health care services tailored to
their regional circumstances. **Investments in Technology Innovation and
Cybersecurity Enhancements for Rural New York:** Expand access to care
through telehealth, improving patient outcomes through eConsult partnerships,
increasing usable alerts in rural counties, and strengthening cybersecurity
of rural facilities. The Department of Health submitted an application to the
Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services on . * [Application Project Summary
