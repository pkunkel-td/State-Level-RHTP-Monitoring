Transformation Program Grant -----------------------------------------
The authorization for the program comes with funding totaling $50 billion
for all states over five years. The funding is divided into two buckets. *
**50% or $25B distributed equally among approved states.** If all states
are approved, Idaho will receive $100M annually for five years, for a total
$500M. * **50% or $25B distributed on the criteria below. Idaho could get
up to an additional $100M annually if awarded.** * Population in rural
areas * Proportion of rural healthcare facilities in the state compared
to national facilities * Financial health of rural hospitals * Other
factors Idaho’s Collaborative Approach ------------------------------
The Department of Health and Welfare (DHW) submitted Idaho’s grant
application on Nov. 4. The application was crafted in close consultation
with the[Idaho Rural Health Taskforce, created by Governor Brad Little last
month](https://gov.idaho.gov/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/eo-2025-08.pdf "(opens
in a new window)"), which included legislative leaders, tribal representation,
and executive branch officials from across state government. DHW also
solicited input from stakeholders and the public through a survey on how
the grant funds should be used. The survey was promoted and available for
about a month. More than 500 respondents from every county in the state
submitted responses about how to prioritize funds. Approximately 200 of
those respondents submitted concepts or ideas. Survey respondents were able
to self-select if they were a member of the public or a stakeholder. Of
the 503 surveys received, 216 indicated they were from the public, and 287
indicated they were rural health stakeholders. The top scoring use of funds
by respondents: * Recruiting and retaining clinical workforce talent to rural
areas, with commitments to serve rural communities for a minimum of 5 years. *
Assisting rural communities to right-size their healthcare delivery systems
by identifying needed preventative, ambulatory, pre-hospital, emergency,
acute inpatient care, outpatient care, and post-acute care service lines. *
Promoting evidence-based, measurable interventions to improve prevention
and chronic disease management. Idaho's application is built around five
initiatives identified based on feedback from the public, the five federally
recognized tribes in Idaho, Idaho legislators, and others. The initiatives are:
* Initiative 1: Improving rural access to care through technology. * Initiative
2: Ensuring accessible, quality care through innovative models. * Initiative
3: Sustaining rural workforce with training, recruitment, and retention. *
Initiative 4: Implementing population-specific, evidence-based projects to
make rural America healthy again. * Initiative 5: Investing in rural health
infrastructure and partnerships. Idaho expects to learn how much it will
receive on December 31, 2025. The funding will be subawarded in accordance
with Idaho procurement law. More details to come. [Read the application
