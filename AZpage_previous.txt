Arizona Rural Health Transformation Program Toolkit Arizona Rural Health Transformation Program Toolkit =================================================== The One Big Beautiful Bill Act (OBBBA) was signed into law 7/4/25. Title VII, Sec. 71401 Rural Health Transformation Program. **RHTP** allocates _$10 billion per year for five fiscal_ years 2026-30. Half will be distributed to states equally, $100 million/yr X 5, upon approval by the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) of each state’s RHTP Plan. **The Governor’s Office leads Arizona’s response to the RHTP opportunity.** CMS posted the notice of funding opportunity to states on 9/15/25 2025. States must submit their RHTP Plan by 11/5/2025. CMS must approve or deny state proposals by 12/31/25. States must submit an annual expenditure report (Fed FY: Oct 1 to Sept 30). States cannot use RHTP funding to finance the non-federal Medicaid match requirement. Administrative costs must be <10% of a state’s RHTP allotment. As the State Office of Rural Health, the Arizona Center for Rural Health can offer resources, like letters of support, to organizations who are writing rural-focused grant applications. If you are interested in a **letter of support** from us, please [submit the request](https://redcap.link/7bkadhsh) form. ### [Governor's Office October and November Rural Health Transformation
