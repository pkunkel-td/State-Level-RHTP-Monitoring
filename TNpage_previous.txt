Future of Better Care, Closer to Home ---------------------------------------
_**Check this Page in the Upcoming Weeks for Information on Competitive
Opportunities**_ Tennessee’s rural communities are the heart of the state’s
economy, culture, and identity. The federal**_Rural Health Transformation
Program_**(RHTP) presents Tennessee with a historic opportunity to improve
healthcare access, quality, and outcomes in our rural communities for
generations to come. Tennessee’s RHTP plan is foundational building a
locally-led model for how rural America can become healthy, vibrant, and
self-sustaining, and bring**_Better Care, Closer to Home_**. The**_Tennessee
RHTP Plan_**proposes investment that reverses rural hospital decline, extends
care access, modernizes technology, and strengthens local economies, while
improving outcomes for mothers, children, and older adults. ### Tennsessee's

Support for rural health administration leadership Rural Health is America's
Health -------------------------------- On , Congress passed H.R. 1, the One
Big Beautiful Bill Act, creating an unprecedented opportunity to transform
rural healthcare in Tennessee. Through the new Rural Health Transformation
Program, States can apply for up to $10 billion per year for five years
to expand access, improve care, and strengthen local health systems. Half
of these funds—$5 billion annually—will be shared equally among all
participating states, while the other half will be directed where it’s
needed most, based on guidance from the U.S. Department of Health and Human
Services. This program offers Tennessee a historic chance to build healthier,
stronger rural communities for generations to come. ### Strategic Pillars
#### Make Rural America Healthy Advance rural health by expanding access and
promoting prevention through evidence-based interventions in chronic disease
management, behavioral health, and prenatal care. #### Sustainable Access
Strengthen rural providers as sustainable access points by enhancing efficiency
and collaboration with regional systems in care delivery, technology, and
emergency services. #### Workforce Development Recruit and retain skilled
healthcare providers, health workers, and pharmacists in rural communities
to meet local access needs. #### Innovative Care Promote innovative care
models and payment strategies that improve outcomes, coordinate services,
and shift care to more efficient, cost-effective settings. #### Tech
Innovation Advance digital health by expanding telehealth, improving data
sharing and cybersecurity, and supporting adoption of emerging healthcare
technologies. States Can Pick Three --------------------- The Rural Health
Transformation Program requires each state to pick three areas of focus
from the following list of approved uses for the RHT funding: * Promoting
evidence-based, measurable interventions to improve prevention and chronic
disease management. * Providing payments to health care providers for the
provision of health care items or services. * Promoting consumer-facing,
technology-driven solutions for the prevention and management of chronic
diseases. * Providing training and technical assistance for the development
and adoption of technology-enabled solutions that improve care delivery
in rural hospitals, including remote monitoring, robotics, artificial
intelligence, and other advanced technologies. * Recruiting and retaining
clinical workforce talent to rural areas, with commitments to serve rural
communities for a minimum of 5 years. * Providing technical assistance,
software, and hardware for significant information technology advances
designed to improve efficiency, enhance cybersecurity capability development,
and improve patient health outcomes. * Assisting rural communities to right
size their health care delivery systems by identifying needed preventative,
ambulatory, pre-hospital, emergency, acute inpatient care, outpatient care,
and post-acute care service lines. * Supporting access to opioid use disorder
treatment services (as defined in section 1861(jjj)(1)), other substance
use disorder treatment services, and mental health services. * Developing
projects that support innovative models of care that include value-based care
arrangements and alternative payment models, as appropriate. * Additional
uses designed to promote sustainable access to high quality rural health care
services: Capital expenditures and infrastructure:Investing in existing rural
health care facility buildings and infrastructure, including minor building
alterations or renovations and equipment upgrades to ensure long-term overhead
and upkeep costs are commensurate with patient volume, subject to restrictions
in the funding policies and limitations. Fostering collaboration:Initiating,
fostering, and strengthening local and regional strategic partnerships
between rural facilities and other health care providers to promote
quality improvement, improve financial stability of rural facilities,
and expand access to care. Frequently Asked Questions on Rural Healthcare
Transformation -------------------------------------------------------------
### What will be included in the RHT plan? The rural health transformation
plan must describe how the state would use funds from the program to: *
Improve access to hospitals, other health care providers, and health care
items and services furnished to rural residents of the state * Improve health
care outcomes of rural residents of the state * Prioritize the use of new
and emerging technologies that emphasize prevention and chronic disease
management * Initiate, foster and strengthen local and regional strategic
partnerships between rural hospitals and other health care providers to
promote measurable quality improvement, increase financial stability, maximize
economies of scale, and share best practices in care delivery * Enhance
economic opportunity for, and the supply of, health care clinicians through
enhanced recruitment and training * Prioritize data and technology driven
solutions that help rural hospitals and other rural health care providers
furnish high-quality health care services as close to a patient’s home
as is possible * Outline strategies to manage long-term financial solvency
and operating models of rural hospitals in the state * Identify specific
causes driving the accelerating rate of stand-alone rural hospitals at risk
of closure, conversion or service reduction. Annual allotments distributed to
states would remain available for use through the end of the second succeeding
FY. Beginning in 2028, amounts allotted but unused would be redistributed in
accordance with a methodology specified by the CMS Administrator. Redistributed
amounts would remain available for use by the state through the end of the
second succeeding fiscal year. States would not be required to match awarded
allotments. ### What activities does the funding allow? Allowable activities

The Unique Healthcare Challenges in Tennessee's Rural Communities
----------------------------------------------------------------- Tennessee’s
rural communities face unique health care challenges that impact both physical
and behavioral health. Rural Tennesseans often experience diminished access
to care, in part due to limited availability of health care facilities,
long travel times to receive care, workforce shortages for high-demand
health care professions, and a high cost of health care. In recent years,
Tennessee has prioritized programs and resources to improve rural health
care, including the Health Care Modernization Task Force, Healthy Smiles
Initiative, Tennessee Rural Hospital Transformation Act of 2018, Tennessee
Broadband Accessibility Act, and the Small and Rural Hospital Readiness
Grant Program. Recognizing the opportunity to build upon these initiatives,
Governor Bill Lee established the Tennessee Rural Health Care Task Force,
led as a public-private partnership originating in the Tennessee Department
of Health and charged with developing a set of recommendations to improve
rural health care across Tennessee. Engaging Partners for the Health of Rural
Tennessee --------------------------------------------------- The Tennessee
Department of Health expects to meet the RHT grant's application deadline
of early November 2025. Right now, TDH is actively engaging with Tennessee
Gov. Bill Lee, members of the Tennessee General Assembly, and Tennessee
stakeholders in rural health to gather ideas and input for a meaningful
response to this significant grant opportunity. You can have a lasting impact,
too. If you have comments, feedback, ideas, proposals, or suggestions, even
if it's providing a letter of support on behalf of Tennessee's effort, please
send an email to [Rural.Health@tn.gov](mailto:rural.health@tn.gov "Email
