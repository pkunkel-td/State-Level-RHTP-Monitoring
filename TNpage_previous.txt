--------------------------------------- _**Check this Page in the Upcoming
Weeks for Information on Competitive Opportunities**_ Tennessee’s rural
communities are the heart of the state’s economy, culture, and identity. The
federal**_Rural Health Transformation Program_**(RHTP) presents Tennessee with
a historic opportunity to improve healthcare access, quality, and outcomes
in our rural communities for generations to come. Tennessee’s RHTP plan is
foundational building a locally-led model for how rural America can become
healthy, vibrant, and self-sustaining, and bring**_Better Care, Closer to
Home_**. The**_Tennessee RHTP Plan_**proposes investment that reverses
rural hospital decline, extends care access, modernizes technology, and
strengthens local economies, while improving outcomes for mothers, children,
and older adults. [See Gov. Lee's Announcement of Tennessee's Proposal

& behavioral health scholarships * Support for rural health administration
leadership Rural Health is America's Health --------------------------------
On , Congress passed H.R. 1, the One Big Beautiful Bill Act, creating an
unprecedented opportunity to transform rural healthcare in Tennessee. Through
the new Rural Health Transformation Program, States can apply for up
to $10 billion per year for five years to expand access, improve care,
and strengthen local health systems. Half of these funds—$5 billion
annually—will be shared equally among all participating states, while
the other half will be directed where it’s needed most, based on guidance
from the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services. This program offers
Tennessee a historic chance to build healthier, stronger rural communities for
generations to come. [Learn More at the CMS Rural Health Transformation Program

[See the RHT Notice of Funding Opportunity on
Grants.gov](https://grants.gov/search-results-detail/360442) * * * ###
Strategic Pillars #### Make Rural America Healthy Advance rural health by
expanding access and promoting prevention through evidence-based interventions
in chronic disease management, behavioral health, and prenatal care. ####
Sustainable Access Strengthen rural providers as sustainable access points by
enhancing efficiency and collaboration with regional systems in care delivery,
technology, and emergency services. #### Workforce Development Recruit and
retain skilled healthcare providers, health workers, and pharmacists in
rural communities to meet local access needs. #### Innovative Care Promote
innovative care models and payment strategies that improve outcomes, coordinate
services, and shift care to more efficient, cost-effective settings. ####
Tech Innovation Advance digital health by expanding telehealth, improving data
sharing and cybersecurity, and supporting adoption of emerging healthcare
technologies. States Can Pick Three --------------------- The Rural Health
Transformation Program requires each state to pick three areas of focus
from the following list of approved uses for the RHT funding: * Promoting
evidence-based, measurable interventions to improve prevention and chronic
disease management. * Providing payments to health care providers for the
provision of health care items or services. * Promoting consumer-facing,
technology-driven solutions for the prevention and management of chronic
diseases. * Providing training and technical assistance for the development
and adoption of technology-enabled solutions that improve care delivery
in rural hospitals, including remote monitoring, robotics, artificial
intelligence, and other advanced technologies. * Recruiting and retaining
clinical workforce talent to rural areas, with commitments to serve rural
communities for a minimum of 5 years. * Providing technical assistance,
software, and hardware for significant information technology advances
designed to improve efficiency, enhance cybersecurity capability development,
and improve patient health outcomes. * Assisting rural communities to right
size their health care delivery systems by identifying needed preventative,
ambulatory, pre-hospital, emergency, acute inpatient care, outpatient care,
and post-acute care service lines. * Supporting access to opioid use disorder
treatment services (as defined in section 1861(jjj)(1)), other substance
use disorder treatment services, and mental health services. * Developing
projects that support innovative models of care that include value-based care
arrangements and alternative payment models, as appropriate. * Additional
uses designed to promote sustainable access to high quality rural health care
services: Capital expenditures and infrastructure:Investing in existing rural
health care facility buildings and infrastructure, including minor building
alterations or renovations and equipment upgrades to ensure long-term overhead
and upkeep costs are commensurate with patient volume, subject to restrictions
in the funding policies and limitations. Fostering collaboration:Initiating,
fostering, and strengthening local and regional strategic partnerships
between rural facilities and other health care providers to promote quality
improvement, improve financial stability of rural facilities, and expand access
to care. [Learn more at the Rural Health Transformation Program website from

Frequently Asked Questions on Rural Healthcare Transformation
------------------------------------------------------------- ### What
will be included in the RHT plan? The rural health transformation plan must
describe how the state would use funds from the program to: * Improve access
to hospitals, other health care providers, and health care items and services
furnished to rural residents of the state * Improve health care outcomes
of rural residents of the state * Prioritize the use of new and emerging
technologies that emphasize prevention and chronic disease management *
Initiate, foster and strengthen local and regional strategic partnerships
between rural hospitals and other health care providers to promote measurable
quality improvement, increase financial stability, maximize economies of scale,
and share best practices in care delivery * Enhance economic opportunity
for, and the supply of, health care clinicians through enhanced recruitment
and training * Prioritize data and technology driven solutions that help
rural hospitals and other rural health care providers furnish high-quality
health care services as close to a patient’s home as is possible * Outline
strategies to manage long-term financial solvency and operating models of rural
hospitals in the state * Identify specific causes driving the accelerating
rate of stand-alone rural hospitals at risk of closure, conversion or service
reduction. Annual allotments distributed to states would remain available
for use through the end of the second succeeding FY. Beginning in 2028,
amounts allotted but unused would be redistributed in accordance with a
methodology specified by the CMS Administrator. Redistributed amounts would
remain available for use by the state through the end of the second succeeding
fiscal year. States would not be required to match awarded allotments. * *

The Unique Healthcare Challenges in Tennessee's Rural Communities
----------------------------------------------------------------- Tennessee’s
rural communities face unique health care challenges that impact both physical
and behavioral health. Rural Tennesseans often experience diminished access
to care, in part due to limited availability of health care facilities,
long travel times to receive care, workforce shortages for high-demand
health care professions, and a high cost of health care. In recent
years, Tennessee has prioritized programs and resources to improve rural
health care, including the Health Care Modernization Task Force, Healthy
Smiles Initiative, Tennessee Rural Hospital Transformation Act of 2018,
Tennessee Broadband Accessibility Act, and the Small and Rural Hospital
Readiness Grant Program. Recognizing the opportunity to build upon these
initiatives, Governor Bill Lee established the Tennessee Rural Health Care
Task Force, led as a public-private partnership originating in the Tennessee
Department of Health and charged with developing a set of recommendations
to improve rural health care across Tennessee. [2023 Rural Health
