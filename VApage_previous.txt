Translate is a third-party service provided by Google that performs all
translations directly and dynamically. By detecting patterns in documents
that have already been translated by human translators, Google Translate
can make intelligent guesses as to what an appropriate translation should
be. This process of seeking patterns in large amounts of text is called
“statistical machine translation”. Since the translations are generated
by machines, not all translation will be perfect. The more human-translated
documents that Google Translate can analyze in a specific language, the better
the translation quality will be. This is why translation accuracy will vary
across languages. ### Disclaimer The Virginia Information Technologies Agency
