------------------- Rural Health Transformation Program (RHTP) The
Rural Health Transformation Program (RHTP) was created under the Working
Families Tax Cuts Act to help state governments strengthen healthcare

(CMS) and focuses on promoting innovation, strategic partnerships,
infrastructure development and workforce investment. Each state must
apply for funding through the RHTP. CMS' has established the following
strategic goals for the RHTP: * **Make rural America healthy again**
* **Sustainable access** * **Workforce development** * **Innovative
care** * **Tech innovation** For more information, please visit CMS' website at

Rural & Medically Underserved Area Grant To improve access to necessary
medical services across the state, especially in rural and medically
underserved areas and communities, SCDHHS created a grant opportunity to
support the creation and/or renovation of healthcare facilities that serve
these targeted populations. Increasing patient access is essential to improving
the health outcomes of these populations, reducing the overall cost of care,
and addressing the growing health disparities in these areas. Funds received
under this grant must be used as **one-time infrastructure funds**to support
rural and medically underserved areas through the creation or improvement of
facilities that provide healthcare services to residents of those areas. The
goal of the Rural & Medically Underserved Area Grant Opportunity is to
promote the creation and/or improvement of healthcare facilities that
deliver services that are high quality, cost-effective, coordinated,
and equitable in rural and medically underserved settings. In order to
achieve these goals, facilities have committed to improving health outcomes,
increasing access to essential healthcare services, and providing quality
care. SCDHHS has issued $48.2 million in total funds to healthcare providers
across the state to create and/or improve access to healthcare services in
these rural and medically underserved areas. Grant awardees were awarded
up to $3 million per application. **The deadline to submit completed grant
application packets to**[grants@scdhhs.gov](mailto:grants@scdhhs.gov)**was
Monday, Dec. 4, 2023.** Grant awardees were notified via email on
the grant award date, Feb. 2, 2024. View the list of the awardees below.

Behavioral Health Crisis Stabilization Services Grant To address the state’s
need for behavioral health crisis stabilization services, SCDHHS created a
grant opportunity to increase access to these services in hospitals across
the state. Crisis stabilization services grant funds must be used as one-time
infrastructure funds to build specialized hospital-based emergency departments
and observational units dedicated to behavioral health. These dedicated
departments and units will need to operate on a “no wrong door” model
providing a care alternative to emergency or inpatient admission or use of
law enforcement resources that is available 24 hours per day, 365 days per
year. The South Carolina Department of Health and Environmental Control (DHEC)
has issued guidance on hospital-based crisis stabilization units, like those
that may be built using SCDHHS’ behavioral health crisis stabilization
services grant funds. The guidance addresses potential certificate
of need and licensure implications and is [available on DHEC’s website
here](https://dph.sc.gov/search?search=search?search=healthcare-quality/hospital-based-crisis-stabilization-units).
SCDHHS will issue approximately $35,000,000 in total funds to hospitals across
the state to build these specialized hospital-based emergency departments and
observational units. **The deadline to submit completed grant application
packets to**[grants@scdhhs.gov](mailto:grants@scdhhs.gov)**was
