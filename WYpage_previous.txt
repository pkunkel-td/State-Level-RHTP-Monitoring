Health Transformation Program =============================================
On , President Trump signed the _One Big Beautiful Bill Act_(OBBBA)
into law. Part of that law creates the Rural Health Transformation
Program. This new program offers Wyoming a significant opportunity
to strengthen rural healthcare through sustainable, innovative, and
transformative solutions. **Funding under this program is intended to
support priorities such as:** * Chronic disease prevention and behavioral
health; * Sustaining access to care in rural communities; * Innovative
approaches to care delivery and payment models; * Workforce development and
training; * Technological and consumer health solutions; and * IT advances
and technical assistance. [Rural Health Transformation Program Document
